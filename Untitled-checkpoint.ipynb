As I have told you, theory is very \\ngood indeed, but how are we  to carry it into practice? If it be \\nabsolutely impracticable, no theory is of any value whatever, \\nexcept as intellectual gymnastics. The Vedanta, therefore, as a \\nreligion must be intensely practical. We must be able to carry it \\nout in every part of our lives. And not only this, the fictitious \\ndifferentiation between religion and the life of the world must \\nvanish, for the Vedanta teaches oneness — one life throughout. \\n \\nThe ideals of religion must cover the whole field of life, they must \\nenter into all our  thoughts, and more and more into practice. I will \\nenter gradually on the practical side as we proceed. But this series \\nof lectures is intended to be a basis, and so we must first apply \\nourselves to theories and understand how they are worked out, \\nproceeding from forest caves  to busy streets and cities; and one \\npeculiar feature we find is that many  of these thoughts have been \\nthe outcome, not of retirement into forests, but have emanated from \\npersons whom we expect to  lead the busiest lives — from ruling \\nmonarchs.'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'www.ilovepdf.com', 'creator': 'Microsoft® Word 2016', 'creationdate': '2025-02-14T11:48:12+00:00', 'author': 'Indianistic Purely Desi', 'moddate': '2025-02-14T11:48:12+00:00', 'source': 'Knowledge is Strength Contest (ebook).pdf', 'total_pages': 122, 'page': 3, 'page_label': '4'}, page_content='4 \\n \\n \\nShvetaketu was the son of Âruni, a sage, most probably a \\nrecluse. He was brought up in the forest, but he went to the city \\nof the Panchâlas and appeared at the court of the king, \\nPravâhana Jaivali. The king asked him, \"Do you know how \\nbeings depart hence at death?\" \"No, sir.\" \"Do you know how \\nthey return hither?\" \"No, sir.\" \"Do you know the way of the \\nfathers and the way of the gods?\" \"No, sir.\" Then the king asked \\nother questions. Shvetaketu could not answer them. So the king \\ntold him that he knew nothing. The boy went back to his father, \\nand the father admitted that  he himself could not answer these \\nquestions. It  was not that he was unwilling to answer these \\nquestions. It was not that he was unwilling to teach the boy, but \\nhe did not know these things. So he went to the king and asked \\nto be taught these secrets. The king said that these things had \\nbeen hitherto known only  among kings; the priests never knew \\nthem.  \\n \\nHe, however, proceeded to teach him what he desired to know. \\nIn various Upanishads we find that  this Vedanta philosophy is \\nnot the outcome of meditation in the forests only, but that the \\nvery best parts of  it were thought  out and expressed by brains \\nwhich were busiest  in the everyday affairs of life. We cannot \\nconceive any man busier than an absolute monarch, a man who \\nis ruling over millions of  people, and yet, some of these rulers \\nwere deep thinkers.'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'www.ilovepdf.com', 'creator': 'Microsoft® Word 2016', 'creationdate': '2025-02-14T11:48:12+00:00', 'author': 'Indianistic Purely Desi', 'moddate': '2025-02-14T11:48:12+00:00', 'source': 'Knowledge is Strength Contest (ebook).pdf', 'total_pages': 122, 'page': 4, 'page_label': '5'}, page_content='5 \\n \\nEverything goes to show that this philosophy must be very \\npractical; and later on, when we come to the Bhagavad-Gita — \\nmost of you, perhaps, have read it, it is the best commentary we \\nhave on the Vedanta philosophy — curiously enough the scene \\nis laid on the battlefield, where Krishna teaches this philosophy \\nto Arjuna; and the doctrine which stands out luminously in \\nevery page of the Gita is intense activity, but in the midst of it, \\neternal calmness. This is the secret of work, to attain which is  \\nthe goal of the Vedanta. Inactivity, as we understand it in the \\nsense of passivity, certainly cannot be the goal. Were it so, then \\nthe walls around us would be the  most intelligent; they are \\ninactive. Clods of  earth, stumps of trees, would be the greatest \\nsages in the world; they are inactive. Nor does inactivity become \\nactivity when it is combined with passion. \\n \\nReal activity, which is the goal of Vedanta, is combined with \\neternal calmness, the calmness which cannot  be ruffled,  the \\nbalance of mind which is never disturbed, whatever happens.  \\nAnd we all know from our experience in life that that is the best \\nattitude for work. I have been asked many times how  we can \\nwork if we do not have the passion which we generally feel for \\nwork. I also thought in that way years ago, but as I am growing \\nolder, getting more experience, I  find it is not true.  The less \\npassion there is, the better we work. The calmer  we are, the \\nbetter for us, and the more the amount of work we can do.

It is only when the mind is very \\ncalm and collected that the whole of its energy is spent in doing \\ngood work. \\n \\nAnd if you read the lives of the great workers which the world \\nhas produced, you will  find that they were wonderfully calm \\nmen. Nothing, as it were, could throw them off their balance. \\nThat is why the man who becomes angry never does a great \\namount of work, and the man whom nothing can make angry \\naccomplishes so much. The man who gives way  to anger, or \\nhatred, or any other passion, cannot work; he only breaks \\nhimself to pieces, and does nothing practical. It is the calm, \\nforgiving, equable, well -balanced mind that does the greatest \\namount of work. The Vedanta preaches the ideal; and the ideal, \\nas we know, is always far ahead of the real, of the practical, as \\nwe may call it. There are two tendencies in human nature: one \\nto harmonise the ideal with the life, and the other to elevate the \\nlife to the ideal. \\n \\nIt is a great thing to understand thi s, for the former tendency is \\nthe temptation of our lives. I think that I can only do a certain \\nclass of work. Most of it, perhaps, is bad; most of it, perhaps, \\nhas a motive power of passion behind it, anger, or greed, or \\nselfishness. Now if any man comes to preach to me a certain \\nideal, the first step towards which is to give up selfishness, to \\ngive up self-enjoyment, I think that is impractical.

What I think is \\npractical, is to me the only practicality in the world. \\n \\nIf I am a shopkeeper, I think shopkeeping the only practical \\npursuit in the world. If I am a thief, I think stealing is the best \\nmeans of being practical; others are not practical. You see how \\nwe all  use this word practical for  things we like  and can  do. \\nTherefore I will ask you to understand that Vedanta, though it is \\nintensely practical, is always so in the sense of the ideal. It does \\nnot preach an impossible ideal, however high it be, and it is high \\nenough for an ideal. In one word, this ideal is that you are divine, \\n\"Thou art That\". This is the essence of Vedanta; after all its \\nramifications and intellectual gymnastics, you know the human \\nsoul to be pure and omniscient, you see that such superstitions \\nas birth and death would be entire nonsense when spoken of in \\nconnection with the soul. The soul was never born and will never \\ndie, and all these ideas that we are going to die and are afraid to \\ndie are mere superstitions. And all such ideas as that we can do \\nthis or cannot do that are superstitions. We can do everything. \\n \\nThe Vedanta teaches men to have faith in themselves first. As \\ncertain religions of the world say that a man who does not \\nbelieve in a Personal God outside of himself is an atheist, so the \\nVedanta says,  a man who does not believe in himself is an \\natheist. Not believing  in the glory of our own soul is what the \\nVedanta calls atheism.

This teacher \\ngave Satyakama four hundred lean, weak cows to take care of, \\nand sent him to the forest. There he went and lived for some \\ntime. The teacher had told him to come back when the herd \\nwould increase to the number of one thousand. After a few \\nyears, one day Satyakama heard a big bull in the herd saying to \\nhim, \"We are a thousand now; take us back to your teacher. I \\nwill teach you a little of Brahman.\" \"Say  on, sir,\" said \\nSatyakama. Then the bull said, \"The East is a part of the Lord, \\nso is the West, so is the South, so is the North. The four cardinal \\npoints are the four parts of Brahman. Fire will also teach you \\nsomething of Brahman.\" Fire was a great symbol in those days, \\nand every student had to procure fire and make offerings.  \\n \\nSo on the following day, Satyakama started for his Guru\\'s \\nhouse, and when in the evening he had performed his oblation, \\nand worshipped at the fire, and was  sitting near it, he heard a \\nvoice come from the fire, \"O Satyakama.\" \"Speak, Lord,\" said \\nSatyakama.

We have seen in the \\nSamhitâ that the idea of heaven was that it was eternal, much \\nthe same as is prevalent among Mohammedans and Christians.  \\n \\nThe Mohammedans concretize it a little more. They say it is a \\nplace where there are gardens, beneath which rivers run. In the \\ndesert of Arabia water is  very desirable, so the Mohammedan \\nalways conceives of his heaven as containing much water.

The idea that souls come back is already there. \\nThose persons who do good work with the idea of  a result, get \\nit, but the result is not permanent.

The cause being finite, the effect must be finite. If the cause \\nis eternal the effect  can be eternal, but  all these causes, doing \\ngood work, and all other things, are only finite causes, and as \\nsuch cannot produce infinite result.  \\n \\nWe now come to the other side of the question.

This \\nmorning, I shall try to place before you the Vedantic ideas of the \\nrelation of the particular to the universal. As we have seen, in  \\nthe dualistic form of Vedic doctrines, the earlier forms, there was \\na clearly defined particular and limited soul for every being. \\nThere have been a great many theories about this particular soul \\nin each individual, but the main discussion was between the \\nancient Vedantists and the ancient Buddhists, the former \\nbelieving in the individual soul as complete in itself, the latter \\ndenying in toto the existence of such an individual soul.  \\nAs I told you the other day, it is pretty much the same discussion \\nyou have in Europe as to substance and quality, one set holding \\nthat b ehind the qualities there is something as substance,  in \\nwhich the qualities in here; and the other denying the existence \\nof such a substance as being unnecessary, for the qualities may \\nlive by themselves. The most  ancient theory of the soul, of \\ncourse, is based upon the argument of self -identity— \"I am I\" \\n— that the I of yesterday is the I of today, and the I of today will \\nbe the I of tomorrow; that in spite of all the changes  that are \\nhappening to the body, I yet believe that I am the same I. This  \\nseems to have been the central argument with those who \\nbelieved in a limited, and yet perfectly complete, individual \\nsoul.'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'www.ilovepdf.com', 'creator': 'Microsoft® Word 2016', 'creationdate': '2025-02-14T11:48:12+00:00', 'author': 'Indianistic Purely Desi', 'moddate': '2025-02-14T11:48:12+00:00', 'source': 'Knowledge is Strength Contest (ebook).pdf', 'total_pages': 122, 'page': 65, 'page_label': '66'}, page_content='66 \\n \\n On the other hand, the ancient Buddhists denied the necessity \\nof such an assumption.

One \\nparty says we cannot conceive of changes without conceiving of \\nsomething which does not change; the other party brings out the \\nargument that this is superfluous; we can only conceive of \\nsomething which is changing, and as to the unchanging, we can \\nneither know, feel, nor sense it. \\n In India this great question did not find its solution in very \\nancient times, because we have seen that the assumption of a \\nsubstance which is behind the qualities, and which is not the'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'www.ilovepdf.com', 'creator': 'Microsoft® Word 2016', 'creationdate': '2025-02-14T11:48:12+00:00', 'author': 'Indianistic Purely Desi', 'moddate': '2025-02-14T11:48:12+00:00', 'source': 'Knowledge is Strength Contest (ebook).pdf', 'total_pages': 122, 'page': 66, 'page_label': '67'}, page_content='67 \\n \\nqualities, can never be substantiated; nay, even the argument \\nfrom self- identity, from memory, — that I am the I of yesterday \\nbecause I remember it, and therefore I have been a continuous \\nsomething — cannot be substantiated. The other quibble that is \\ngenerally put forward is a mere delusion of words. For instance, \\na man may take a long series of such sentences as \"I do\", \"I go\", \\n\"I dream\", \"I sleep\", \"I move\", and here you will find it claimed \\nthat the doing, going, dreaming etc.,  have been changing, but \\nwhat remained constant was that \"I\".  \\nAs such they conclude that the \"I\" is something which is \\nconstant and an individual in itself, but all these changes belong \\nto the body.

Thus the argument from \\npersonal identity does not seem to be very strong. The other \\nargument from memory is also weak.  \\nIf the identity of my being is represented by my memory, many \\nthings which I have forgotten are lost from that identity. And we \\nknow that people under certain conditions forget their whole \\npast. In many cases of lunacy, a man will think of himself as \\nmade of glass, or as being an animal.

According to them, the soul consists  of a \\nbundle of qualities called sensations and feelings. A mass of \\nsuch is what is  called the soul, and this mass is continually \\nchanging. The Advaitist theory of the soul reconciles both these \\npositions. The position of the Advaitist is that it is true that we \\ncannot think of the substance as separate from the qualities, we \\ncannot think of change and not -change at the same time; it \\nwould be impossible. But the very thing which is the substance \\nis the quality; substance and quality are not two things. It is the \\nunchangeable that is appearing as the changeable.  \\n \\nThe unchangeable substance of the universe is not something \\nseparate from it. The noumenon  is not something different from \\nthe phenomena, but it is the very noumenon which has become \\nthe phenomena.

\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nSWAMI VIVEKANANDA', '3 \\n \\n \\nPractical Vedanta \\nPart – 1 \\n(Delivered in London, 10th November 1896) \\n \\nI have been asked to say something about the practical position \\nof the Vedanta philosophy. As I have told you, theory is very \\ngood indeed, but how are we  to carry it into practice? If it be \\nabsolutely impracticable, no theory is of any value whatever, \\nexcept as intellectual gymnastics. The Vedanta, therefore, as a \\nreligion must be intensely practical. We must be able to carry it', 'out in every part of our lives. And not only this, the fictitious \\ndifferentiation between religion and the life of the world must \\nvanish, for the Vedanta teaches oneness — one life throughout. \\n \\nThe ideals of religion must cover the whole field of life, they must \\nenter into all our  thoughts, and more and more into practice. I will \\nenter gradually on the practical side as we proceed. But this series \\nof lectures is intended to be a basis, and so we must first apply', 'ourselves to theories and understand how they are worked out, \\nproceeding from forest caves  to busy streets and cities; and one \\npeculiar feature we find is that many  of these thoughts have been \\nthe outcome, not of retirement into forests, but have emanated from \\npersons whom we expect to  lead the busiest lives — from ruling \\nmonarchs.', '4 \\n \\n \\nShvetaketu was the son of Âruni, a sage, most probably a \\nrecluse. He was brought up in the forest, but he went to the city \\nof the Panchâlas and appeared at the court of the king, \\nPravâhana Jaivali. The king asked him, \"Do you know how \\nbeings depart hence at death?\" \"No, sir.\" \"Do you know how \\nthey return hither?\" \"No, sir.\" \"Do you know the way of the \\nfathers and the way of the gods?\" \"No, sir.\" Then the king asked \\nother questions. Shvetaketu could not answer them. So the king', 'told him that he knew nothing. The boy went back to his father, \\nand the father admitted that  he himself could not answer these \\nquestions. It  was not that he was unwilling to answer these \\nquestions. It was not that he was unwilling to teach the boy, but \\nhe did not know these things. So he went to the king and asked \\nto be taught these secrets. The king said that these things had \\nbeen hitherto known only  among kings; the priests never knew \\nthem.', 'them.  \\n \\nHe, however, proceeded to teach him what he desired to know. \\nIn various Upanishads we find that  this Vedanta philosophy is \\nnot the outcome of meditation in the forests only, but that the \\nvery best parts of  it were thought  out and expressed by brains \\nwhich were busiest  in the everyday affairs of life. We cannot \\nconceive any man busier than an absolute monarch, a man who \\nis ruling over millions of  people, and yet, some of these rulers \\nwere deep thinkers.', '5 \\n \\nEverything goes to show that this philosophy must be very \\npractical; and later on, when we come to the Bhagavad-Gita — \\nmost of you, perhaps, have read it, it is the best commentary we \\nhave on the Vedanta philosophy — curiously enough the scene \\nis laid on the battlefield, where Krishna teaches this philosophy \\nto Arjuna; and the doctrine which stands out luminously in \\nevery page of the Gita is intense activity, but in the midst of it,', 'eternal calmness. This is the secret of work, to attain which is  \\nthe goal of the Vedanta. Inactivity, as we understand it in the \\nsense of passivity, certainly cannot be the goal. Were it so, then \\nthe walls around us would be the  most intelligent; they are \\ninactive. Clods of  earth, stumps of trees, would be the greatest \\nsages in the world; they are inactive. Nor does inactivity become \\nactivity when it is combined with passion.', 'activity when it is combined with passion. \\n \\nReal activity, which is the goal of Vedanta, is combined with \\neternal calmness, the calmness which cannot  be ruffled,  the \\nbalance of mind which is never disturbed, whatever happens.  \\nAnd we all know from our experience in life that that is the best \\nattitude for work. I have been asked many times how  we can \\nwork if we do not have the passion which we generally feel for \\nwork. I also thought in that way years ago, but as I am growing', 'older, getting more experience, I  find it is not true.  The less \\npassion there is, the better we work. The calmer  we are, the \\nbetter for us, and the more the amount of work we can do. When \\nwe let loose our feelings, we waste so much energy, shatter our \\nnerves, disturb our minds, and accomplish very little work. The \\nenergy which ought to have gone out  as work is spent as mere', '6 \\n \\nfeeling, which counts for nothing. It is only when the mind is very \\ncalm and collected that the whole of its energy is spent in doing \\ngood work. \\n \\nAnd if you read the lives of the great workers which the world \\nhas produced, you will  find that they were wonderfully calm \\nmen. Nothing, as it were, could throw them off their balance. \\nThat is why the man who becomes angry never does a great \\namount of work, and the man whom nothing can make angry', 'accomplishes so much. The man who gives way  to anger, or \\nhatred, or any other passion, cannot work; he only breaks \\nhimself to pieces, and does nothing practical. It is the calm, \\nforgiving, equable, well -balanced mind that does the greatest \\namount of work. The Vedanta preaches the ideal; and the ideal, \\nas we know, is always far ahead of the real, of the practical, as \\nwe may call it. There are two tendencies in human nature: one', 'to harmonise the ideal with the life, and the other to elevate the \\nlife to the ideal. \\n \\nIt is a great thing to understand thi s, for the former tendency is \\nthe temptation of our lives. I think that I can only do a certain \\nclass of work. Most of it, perhaps, is bad; most of it, perhaps, \\nhas a motive power of passion behind it, anger, or greed, or \\nselfishness. Now if any man comes to preach to me a certain \\nideal, the first step towards which is to give up selfishness, to', 'give up self-enjoyment, I think that is impractical. But when a \\nman brings an ideal which can be reconciled with my \\nselfishness, I am glad at once and jump at it.That is the ideal for', '7 \\n \\nme. As the word \"orthodox\" has been manipulated  into various \\nforms, so has been the word \"practical\". \"My doxy is orthodoxy; \\nyour doxy is heterodoxy.\" So with practicality. What I think is \\npractical, is to me the only practicality in the world. \\n \\nIf I am a shopkeeper, I think shopkeeping the only practical \\npursuit in the world. If I am a thief, I think stealing is the best \\nmeans of being practical; others are not practical. You see how', 'we all  use this word practical for  things we like  and can  do. \\nTherefore I will ask you to understand that Vedanta, though it is \\nintensely practical, is always so in the sense of the ideal. It does \\nnot preach an impossible ideal, however high it be, and it is high \\nenough for an ideal. In one word, this ideal is that you are divine, \\n\"Thou art That\". This is the essence of Vedanta; after all its \\nramifications and intellectual gymnastics, you know the human', 'soul to be pure and omniscient, you see that such superstitions \\nas birth and death would be entire nonsense when spoken of in \\nconnection with the soul. The soul was never born and will never \\ndie, and all these ideas that we are going to die and are afraid to \\ndie are mere superstitions. And all such ideas as that we can do \\nthis or cannot do that are superstitions. We can do everything. \\n \\nThe Vedanta teaches men to have faith in themselves first. As', 'certain religions of the world say that a man who does not \\nbelieve in a Personal God outside of himself is an atheist, so the \\nVedanta says,  a man who does not believe in himself is an \\natheist. Not believing  in the glory of our own soul is what the \\nVedanta calls atheism. To many this is, no doubt, a terrible idea;', '8 \\n \\nand most of us think that this ideal can never be reached; but the \\nVedanta insists that it can be realised by every one.There is \\nneither man nor woman or child, nor difference of race  or sex, \\nnor anything that stands as a bar to the realisation of  the ideal, \\nbecause Vedanta shows that it is realised already, it is already \\nthere. \\n \\nAll the powers in the universe are already ours. It is we who have \\nput our hands before our eyes and cry that it is dark.', 'Know that there is no darkness around us. Take the hands away \\nand there is the  light which was from the beginning. Darkness \\nnever existed, weakness never existed. We who are fools cry that \\nwe are weak; we who are fools cry that we are impure. Thus \\nVedanta not only insists that the ideal is practical, but that it has \\nbeen so all the time; and this Ideal, this Reality, is our own \\nnature. Everything else that you see is false, untrue. As soon as', 'you say, \"I am a little mortal being,\" you are saying  something \\nwhich is not true, you are  giving the lie to yourselves, you are \\nhypnotising yourselves into something vile and weak and \\nwretched. The Vedanta recognises  no sin, it  only recognises \\nerror. And the greatest error, says the Vedanta, is to say that you \\nare weak, that you are a sinner, a  miserable creature, and that  \\nyou have no power and you cannot do this and that. Every time', 'you think in that way, you, as it were, rivet one more link in the \\nchain that binds you down, you add one more layer of hypnotism \\non to your own soul. Therefore, whosoever thinks he is weak is \\nwrong, whosoever thinks he is impure is wrong, and is throwing \\na bad thought into the world.This we must always bear in mind', '9 \\n \\nthat in the Vedanta there is no attempt at reconciling the present \\nlife — the hypnotised life, this false life which we have assumed \\n— with the ideal; but this false life  must go, and the real life \\nwhich is always existing must manifest itself, must shine out. No \\nman becomes purer and  purer, it is a matter of greater \\nmanifestation. \\n \\nThe veil drops away, and the native purity of the soul begins to \\nmanifest itself. Everything is ours already — infinite purity,', 'freedom, love, and power. The Vedanta also says that not only \\ncan this be realised in the depths of forests or caves, but by men \\nin all possible conditions of life. We have seen that the people \\nwho discovered these truths were neither living in caves nor \\nforests, nor following the ordinary vocations of life, but men \\nwho, we have every reason to believe,  led the busiest of lives, \\nmen who had to command armies, to sit on thrones, and look to', 'the welfare of millions — and all these, in the days of absolute \\nmonarchy, and n ot as in these days when a king is to a great \\nextent a mere figurehead. Yet they could find time to think out \\nall these thoughts, to realise them, and to teach them to  \\nhumanity. How much more then should it be practical for us \\nwhose lives, compared with theirs, are lives of leisure? That we \\ncannot realise  them is a shame to us, seeing that we are', 'comparatively free all the time, having very little to do. My \\nrequirements are as nothing compared with those of an ancient \\nabsolute monarch. My wants are as nothing compared with the \\ndemands of Arjuna on the battlefield of Kurukshetra, \\ncommanding a huge army; and yet he could find time in the', '10 \\n \\nmidst of the din and turmoil of battle to talk the highest \\nphilosophy and to carry it into his life also. Surely we ought to \\nbe able to do as much in this life of ours — comparatively free, \\neasy, and comfortable. \\n \\nMost of us here have more time than  we think we have, if we \\nreally want to use it for good. With the amount of freedom we \\nhave we can attain to two hundred ideals in this life, if we will, \\nbut we must not degrade the ideal to the actual. One of the most', 'insinuating things comes to us in the shape of persons who \\napologise for our mistakes  and teach us how to make special \\nexcuses for all our foolish wants  and foolish desires;and  we \\nthink that their ideal is the only ideal we need have. But it is not \\nso. The Vedanta teaches no such thing. \\n \\nThe actual should be reconciled to the ideal, the present life \\nshould be made to coincide with life eternal. For you must \\nalways remember that the one central ideal of Vedanta is this', 'oneness. There are no two in anything, no two lives, nor even \\ntwo different kinds of life for the two worlds. You will find the \\nVedas speaking of heavens and things like that at first; but later \\non, when they come to the highest ideals of their philosophy, \\nthey brush away all these things. There is but one life, one \\nworld, one existence. Everything is that One, the difference is \\nin degree and not in kind. The difference between our lives is', 'not in kind. The Vedanta entirely denies such ideas as that \\nanimals are separate from men, and that they were made and \\ncreated by God to be used for our food. Some people have been', '11 \\n \\nkind enough to start an antivivisection society. I asked a \\nmember, \"Why do you think, my friend, that it is quite lawful to \\nkill animals for food, and not to kill one or two for scientific \\nexperiments?\" He replied, \"Vivisection is most horrible, but \\nanimals have been given to us for food.\" Oneness includes all \\nanimals. If man\\'s life is immortal, so also is the animal\\'s. \\n \\nThe difference is only in degree and not in kind. The amoeba', 'and I are the same, the difference is only in degree; and from the \\nstandpoint of the highest life, all these differences vanish. A \\nman may see a great deal of difference between grass and a little \\ntree, but if you mount very high, the grass and the biggest tree \\nwill appear much the same. So, from the standpoint of the \\nhighest ideal, the lowest animal and the highest man are the \\nsame. If you believe there is a God, the animals and the highest', 'creatures must be the same. A God who is partial to his children \\ncalled men, and cruel to his children called brute beasts, is worse \\nthan a demon. I would rather die a hundred times than worship \\nsuch a God. My whole life woul d be a fight with such a God . \\nBut there is no difference, and those who say there is, are \\nirresponsible, heartless people who do not know. Here is a case \\nof the word practical used in a wrong sense. I myself may not', 'be a very strict vegetarian, but I understand the ideal. \\n \\nWhen I eat meat I know it is wrong. Even if I am bound to eat it \\nunder certain circumstances, I know it is cruel. I must not drag \\nmy ideal down to the actual and apologise for my weak conduct \\nin this way. The ideal is not to eat flesh, not to injure any being,', \"12 \\n \\nfor all animals are my brothers. If you can think of them as your \\nbrothers, you have made a little headway towards the \\nbrotherhood of all souls, not to speak of the brotherhood of \\nman! That is child's play. You generally find that this is not very \\nacceptable to many, because it teaches them  to give up the \\nactual, and go higher up to the ideal. But if you bring out a \\ntheory which is reconciled with their present conduct, they \\nregard it as entirely practical.\", 'regard it as entirely practical.  \\n \\nThere is this strongly conservative tendency in human nature: \\nwe do not like to move one step forward. I think of mankind \\njust as I read of persons who become frozen in  snow; all such, \\nthey say, want to go to sleep, and if you try to drag them up, \\nthey say, \"Let me sleep; it is so beautiful to sleep in the snow\", \\nand they die there in that sleep. So is our nature. That is what \\nwe are doing all our life, getting frozen from the feet upwards,', 'and yet wanting to sleep. Therefore you must struggle towards \\nthe ideal, and if a man comes who wants to bring that ideal \\ndown to your level, and teach a religion that does not carry that \\nhighest ideal, do not listen to him. To me that  is an \\nimpracticable religion. But if a man teaches a religion which \\npresents the highest ideal, I am ready for him.  Beware when \\nanyone is trying to apologise for sense vanities and sense \\nweaknesses.', 'weaknesses.  \\n \\nIf anyone wants to preach that way to us, poor, sense-bound \\nclods of earth as we have made ourselves  by following that \\nteaching, we shall never progress. I have seen  many of these', '13 \\n \\nthings, have had some experience of the world, and my country \\nis the land where religious sects grow like mushrooms. Every \\nyear new sects arise. But one thing I have marked, that it is only \\nthose that never want to reconcile the man of flesh with the man \\nof truth that make progress. \\n \\nWherever there is this false idea of reconciling fleshly vanities \\nwith the highest ideals, of dragging down God to the level of \\nman, there comes decay. Man should not be degraded to', 'worldly slavery, but should be raised up to God. At the same \\ntime, there i s another side to the question. We must not look \\ndown with contempt on others. All of us are going towards the \\nsame goal.  \\n \\nThe difference between weakness and strength is one of degree; \\nthe difference between virtue and vice is one of degree, the \\ndifference between heaven and hell is one of degree, the \\ndifference between life and death is one of degree, all', 'differences in this world are of degree, and not of kind, because \\noneness is the secret of everything. All is One, which manifests \\nItself, either as th ought, or life, or soul, or body, and the \\ndifference is only in degree. As such, we have no right to look \\ndown with contempt upon those who are not developed exactly \\nin the same degree as we are. Condemn none; if you can stretch \\nout a helping hand, do so. If you cannot, fold your hands, bless \\nyour brothers, and let them go their own way.', '14 \\n \\nDragging down and condemning is not the way to work. Never \\nis work accomplished in that way.  We spend our energies in \\ncondemning others. Criticism and condemnation is a vain way \\nof spending our energies, for in the long run we come to learn \\nthat all are seeing the same thing, are more or less approaching \\nthe same ideal, and that most of our differences are merely \\ndifferences of expression. Take the idea of sin. I was telling you', 'just now the Vedantic idea of it, and the other idea is that man \\nis a sinner. They are practically the same, only the one takes the \\npositive and the other the negative side. One shows to man his \\nstrength and the other his weakness. \\n \\nThere may be weakness, says the Vedanta, but never mind, we \\nwant to grow. Disease was found out as soon  as man was born. \\nEveryone knows his disease; it requires no one to tell us what \\nour diseases are. But thinking all the time that we  are diseased', 'will not cure us  — medicine is necessary. We  may forget  \\nanything outside, we may try to become hypocrites to the \\nexternal world, but in our heart of hearts we all know our \\nweaknesses. But, says the Vedanta, being reminded of weakness \\ndoes not help much; give strength, and st rength does not come \\nby thinking of weakness all the time. The remedy for weakness \\nis not brooding over weakness, but thinking of strength. Teach \\nmen of the strength that is already within them.', 'Instead of telling them they are sinners, the Vedanta takes the \\nopposite position, and says, \"You are pure and perfect, and what \\nyou call sin does not belong to you.\" Sins are very low degrees', '15 \\n \\nof Self- manifestation; manifest your Self in a high degree. That \\nis the one thing to remember; all of us can do that. Neve r say, \\n\"No\", never say, \"I cannot\", for you are infinite. Even time and \\nspace are as nothing compared with your nature. You can do \\nanything and everything, you are almighty. These are the \\nprinciples of ethics, but we shall now come down lower and \\nwork out the details. \\n \\nWe shall see how this Vedanta can be carried into our everyday', 'life, the city life, the country life, the national life, and the home \\nlife of every nation. For, if a religion cannot help man wherever \\nhe may be, wherever he stands, it is not of much  use; it will \\nremain only a theory for the chosen few.  Religion, to help \\nmankind, must be ready and able to help him in whatever \\ncondition he is, in servitude or in freedom, in the depths  of \\ndegradation or on the heights of purity; everywhere, equally, it', 'should be able to come to his aid. The principles of Vedanta, or \\nthe ideal of religion, or whatever you may call it, will be fulfilled \\nby its capacity for performing this great function. \\n \\nThe ideal of faith in ourselves is of the greatest help to us. If \\nfaith in ourselves had been more extensively taught and \\npracticed, I am sure a very large portion of the evils and miseries \\nthat we have would have vanished. Throughout the history of', 'mankind, if any motive power has been more potent than \\nanother in the lives of all great men and women, it is that of faith \\nin themselves. Born with the consciousness that they were to be \\ngreat, they became great.', '16 \\n \\n \\nLet a man go down as low as possible; there mu st come a time \\nwhen out of sheer desperation he will take an upward curve and \\nwill learn to have faith in himself. But it is better for us that we \\nshould know it from the very first. Why should we have all these \\nbitter experiences in order to gain faith in ourselves? We can see \\nthat all the difference between man and man is owing to the \\nexistence or non-existence of faith in himself. Faith in ourselves \\nwill do everything.', 'will do everything. \\n \\nI have experienced it in my own life, and am still doing so; and \\nas I grow older that faith is becoming stronger and stronger. He \\nis an atheist who does not believe in himself. The old religions \\nsaid that he was an atheist who did not believe in God. The new \\nreligion says that he is the atheist who  does not believe in \\nhimself. But it is not selfish faith because the Vedanta, again, is \\nthe doctrine of oneness. It means faith in all, because you are', 'all. Love for yourselves means love for all, love for animals, \\nlove for everything, for you are all one. It is the great faith which \\nwill make the world better. I am sure of that. \\n \\nHe is the highest man who can say with truth, \"I know all about \\nmyself.\" Do you know how much energy, how many powers, \\nhow many forces are still lurking behind that frame of yours? \\n \\nWhat scientist has known all that is i n man? Millions of years \\nhave passed since man first came here, and yet but one', 'infinitesimal part of his powers has been manifested. Therefore,', '17 \\n \\nyou must not say that you are weak. How do you know what \\npossibilities lie behind that degradation on the surfa ce? You \\nknow but little of that which is within you. For behind you is the \\nocean of infinite power and blessedness.  \\n \\n“This Âtman is first to be heard of.” Hear day and night that you \\nare that Soul. Repeat it to yourselves day and night till it enters \\ninto your very veins, till it tingles in every drop of blood, till it', 'is in your flesh and bone. Let the whole body be full of that one \\nideal, \"I am the birthless, the deathless, the blissful, the \\nomniscient, the omnipotent, ever -glorious Soul.\" Think on it \\nday and night; think on it till it becomes part and parcel of your \\nlife. Meditate upon it, and out of that will come work. \"Out of \\nthe fullness of the heart the mouth speaketh,\" and out of the \\nfullness of the heart the hand worketh also. Action will come.', 'Fill yourselves with the ideal; whatever you do, think well on it. \\nAll your actions will be magnified, transformed, deified, by the \\nvery power of the thought. If matter is powerful, thought is \\nomnipotent. \\n \\nBring this thought to bear upon your life, fill your selves with \\nthe thought of your almightiness, your majesty, and your glory. \\nWould to God no superstitions had been put into your head! \\nWould to God we had not been surrounded from our birth by all', 'these superstitious influences and paralysing  ideas of our \\nweakness and vileness! Would to God that mankind had had an \\neasier path through which to attain to the noblest and highest \\ntruths! But man had to pass through all this; do not make the', '18 \\n \\npath more difficult for those who are coming after you. These \\nare sometimes terrible doctrines to teach. I know people who get \\nfrightened at these ideas, but for those who want to be practical, \\nthis is the first thing to learn. Never tell yourselves or others that \\nyou are weak. Do good if you can, but do not injure the world.  \\nYou know in your inmost heart that many of your limited ideas, \\nthis humbling of yourself and praying and weeping to imaginary \\nbeings are superstitions.', 'beings are superstitions.  \\n \\nTell me one case where these prayers have been answered. All \\nthe answers that came were from your own  hearts. You know \\nthere are no ghosts, but no sooner are you in the dark than you \\nfeel a little creepy sensation. That is so because in our childhood \\nwe have had all these fearful ideas put into our heads. But do \\nnot teach these things to others through fe ar of society and \\npublic opinion, through fear of incurring the hatred of friends,', \"or for fear of losing cherished superstitions. Be masters of all \\nthese. What is there to be taught more in religion than the \\noneness of the universe and faith in one's self? All the works of \\nmankind for thousands of years past have been towards this one \\ngoal, and mankind is yet working it out. It is your turn now and \\nyou already know the truth.  \\n \\nFor it has been taught on all sides. Not only philosophy and \\npsychology, but materialistic  sciences have declared it. Where\", 'is the scientific man today who fears to acknowledge the truth of \\nthis oneness of the  universe? Who is there who dares talk of \\nmany worlds? All these are superstitions. There is only one life', '19 \\n \\nand one world, and this one life and one world is appearing to \\nus as manifold. This manifoldness is like  a dream. When you \\ndream, one dream passes away and another comes. You do not \\nlive in your dreams. The dreams come one after another, scene \\nafter scene unfolds before you. So it is in this world of ninety \\nper cent misery and ten per cent happiness. Perhaps after a while \\nit will appear as ninety per cent happiness, and we shall call it', 'heaven, but a time comes to the sage when the whole thing \\nvanishes, and this world appears as God Himself, and his own \\nsoul as God. It is not therefore that there are many worlds, it  is \\nnot that there are many lives.  \\n \\nAll this manifoldness is the manifestation of that One. That One \\nis manifesting Himself as many, as matter, spirit, mind, thought, \\nand everything else. It is that One, manifesting Himself as many. \\nTherefore the first step for us to take is to teach the truth to', 'ourselves and to others. Let the world resound with this ideal,  \\nand let superstitions vanish. Tell it to men who are weak and \\npersist in telling it. You are the Pure One; awake and arise, O \\nmighty one, this sleep does not become you. Awake and arise, \\nit does not befit you. Think not that you are weak and miserable. \\nAlmighty, arise and awake, and manifest your own nature. It is \\nnot fitting that you think yourself a sinner. It is not fitting that \\nyou think yourself weak.', 'you think yourself weak.  \\n \\nSay that to the world, say it to yourselves, and see what  a \\npractical result comes, see how with an electric flash everything \\nis manifested, how everything is changed. Tell that to mankind,', '20 \\n \\nand show them their power. Then we shall learn how to apply it \\nin our daily lives. To be able to use what we call Viveka \\n(discrimination), to learn how in every moment of  our lives, in \\nevery one of our  actions, to discriminate between what is right \\nand wrong, true and false, we shall have to know the test of truth, \\nwhich is purity, oneness. Everything that makes for oneness is \\ntruth. Love is truth, and hatred is false, because hatred makes', 'for multiplicity. It is hatred  that separates man from man; \\ntherefore it is wrong and false. It is a disintegrating power; it \\nseparates and destroys. Love binds, love makes for that oneness. \\nYou become one, the mother with the child, families with the \\ncity, the whole world becomes one with the animals.  \\n \\nFor love is  Existence, God Himself; and  all this is the \\nmanifestation of that One Love, more  or less expressed. The', 'difference is only in degree, but it is  the manifestation of that \\nOne Love throughout. Therefore in all our actions we have to \\njudge whether it is making for diversity or for oneness. If for \\ndiversity we have to give it up, but if it makes for oneness we \\nare sure it is good. So with our thoughts; we have to decide \\nwhether they make for disintegration, multiplicity, or for \\noneness, binding soul to soul and bringing one influence to bear.', 'If they do this, we will take them up, and if not, we will throw \\nthem off as criminal. The whole idea of ethics is that it does not \\ndepend on anything unknowable, it does not teach anything \\nunknown, but in the language of the Upanishad, \"The God \\nwhom you worship as an unknown God, the same I preach unto', '21 \\n \\nthee.\" It is through the Self that you know anything. I see the \\nchair; but to see the chair,  I have first to perceive myself and \\nthen the chair. It is in and through the Self that the chair is \\nperceived.  \\n \\nIt is in and through the Self that you are known to me, that the \\nwhole world is known to me; and therefore to say this Self is \\nunknown is sheer nonsense. Take off the Self and the whole \\nuniverse vanishes. In and through the Self all knowledge comes.', 'Therefore it is the best known of all. It is yourself, that which  \\nyou call I. You may wonder how this I of me can be the I of you. \\nYou may wonder how this limited I can  be the unlimited \\nInfinite, but it is so. The limited is a mere fiction. \\n \\nThe Infinite has been covered up, as it were, and a little of It is \\nmanifesting as the I. Limitation can never come upon the \\nunlimited; it is a fiction. The Self is known, therefore, to every', 'one of us — man, woman, or child — and even to animals. \\nWithout knowing Him we  can neither live nor move, nor have \\nour being; without knowing this Lord of all, we cannot breathe \\nor live a second. The God of the Vedanta is the most known of \\nall and is not the outcome of imagination. If this is not preaching \\na practical God, how else could you teach a practical God? \\nWhere is there a more practical God than He whom I see before \\nme — a God omnipresent, in every being, more real than our', 'senses? For you are He, the Omnipresent God  Almighty, the \\nSoul of your souls, and if I say you are not, I tell an untruth. I \\nknow it, whether at all times I realise it or not. He is the Oneness,', '22 \\n \\nthe Unity of all, the Reality of all life and all existence. These \\nideas of the ethics of Vedanta have to be worked out in detail, \\nand, therefore, you must have patience. As I have told you, we \\nwant to take the subject in detail and work i t up thoroughly, to \\nsee how the ideas grow from very low ideals, and how the one \\ngreat Ideal of oneness has  developed and become shaped into \\nthe universal love; and we ought to study these in order to avoid \\ndangers.', 'dangers. \\n \\nThe world cannot find time to work it up from the lowest steps. \\nBut what is the use of our standing on higher steps if we cannot \\ngive the truth to others coming afterwards? Therefore, it is better \\nto study it in all its workings; and first, it is absolutely necessary \\nto clear the intellectual p ortion, although we know that \\nintellectuality is almost nothing; for it is the heart that is of most \\nimportance. It is through the heart that the Lord is seen, and not', 'through the intellect. The intellect is only the street - cleaner, \\ncleansing the path for  us, a secondary worker, the policeman; \\nbut the policeman is not a positive necessity for the workings of \\nsociety. He is only to stop disturbances, to check wrong -doing, \\nand that is all the work required of the intellect. When you read \\nintellectual books, you think when you have mastered them, \\n\"Bless the Lord that I am out of them\", because the intellect is', 'blind and cannot move of itself, it has neither hands nor feet.  \\n \\nIt is feeling that works, that moves with speed infinitely superior \\nto that of electricity or anything else. Do you feel? — that is the \\nquestion. If you do, you will  see the Lord: It is the feeling that', '23 \\n \\nyou have today  that will  be intensified,  deified, raised to the \\nhighest platform, until it feels  everything, the oneness  in \\neverything, till it feels God in itself and in others. The intellect \\ncan never do that. \"Different methods of speaking words, \\ndifferent methods of explaining the texts of books, these are for \\nthe enjoyment of the learned, not for the salvation of the soul\" \\n(Vivekachudâmani, 58). Those of you who have read Thomas a', 'Kempis know how in every page he insists on this, and almost  \\nevery holy man in the world has insisted on it. Intellect is \\nnecessary, for without it we  fall into crude errors and make all \\nsorts of mistakes. Intellect checks these; but beyond that, do not \\ntry to build anything upon it. It is an inactive, secondary help; \\nthe real help is feeling, love. \\n \\nDo you feel for others? If you do, you are growing in oneness. \\nIf you do not feel for others, you may be the most intellectual', 'giant ever born, but you will be nothing; you are but dry \\nintellect, and you will remain so.

It is feeling \\nthat is the life, the strength, the vitality, without which no', '24 \\n \\namount of intellectual activity can reach God. Intellect is like \\nlimbs without the power of locomotion. It is only when feeling \\nenters and gives them motion that they move and work on \\nothers. That is so all over the world, and it is a thing which you \\nmust always remember. It is one of the most practical things in \\nVedantic morality, for it is the teaching of the Vedanta that you \\nare all prophets, and all must be prophets.', 'are all prophets, and all must be prophets. \\n \\nThe book is not the proof of your conduct, but you are the proof \\nof the book. How do you know that a book teaches truth? \\nBecause you are truth and feel it. That is what the Vedanta says. \\nWhat is the proof of the Christs and Buddhas of the world? That \\nyou and I feel like them. That is how you and I understand that \\nthey were true. Our  prophet-soul is the proof of their prophet -\\nsoul. Your godhead is the proof of God Himself. If you are not', 'a prophet, there never has been anything true of God. If you are \\nnot God, there never was any God, and never will be. \\n \\nThis, says the Vedanta, is the ideal to follow. Every one of us \\nwill have to become a prophet, and you are that already. Only \\nknow it. Never think there is anything impossible for the soul. It \\nis the greatest heresy to think so. If  there is sin, this is the only \\nsin — to say that you are weak, or others are weak.', '25 \\n \\n \\nPart - 2 \\n(Delivered in London, 12th November 1896) \\n \\n \\nI will relate to you a very ancient story from the Chhândogya \\nUpanishad, which tells how knowledge came to a boy. The \\n form of the story is very crude, but we shall find that it contains \\na principle. A young boy said to his mother, \"I am going to \\nstudy the Vedas. Tell me the name of my father and my caste.\" \\nThe mother was not a married woman, and in India the child of', 'a woman who has not been married is considered an outcast; he \\nis not recognised by society and is not entitled to study the \\nVedas. So the poor mother said, \"My child, I do not know your \\nfamily name; I was in service, and served in different places; I \\ndo not know who your father is, but my name is Jabâlâ and your \\nname is Satyakâma.\" The little child went to  a sage and asked \\nto be taken as a student.  \\n \\nThe sage asked him, \"What is the name of your father, and what', 'is your caste?\" The boy repeated to him what he had heard from \\nhis mother. The sage at once said, \"None but a Brâhmin could \\nspeak such a damaging truth about himself. You are a Brahmin \\nand I will teach you. You have not swerved from truth.\" So he \\nkept the boy with him and educated him. Now come some of', '26 \\n \\nthe peculiar methods of education in ancient India. This teacher \\ngave Satyakama four hundred lean, weak cows to take care of, \\nand sent him to the forest. There he went and lived for some \\ntime. The teacher had told him to come back when the herd \\nwould increase to the number of one thousand. After a few \\nyears, one day Satyakama heard a big bull in the herd saying to \\nhim, \"We are a thousand now; take us back to your teacher. I \\nwill teach you a little of Brahman.\" \"Say  on, sir,\" said', 'Satyakama. Then the bull said, \"The East is a part of the Lord, \\nso is the West, so is the South, so is the North. The four cardinal \\npoints are the four parts of Brahman. Fire will also teach you \\nsomething of Brahman.\" Fire was a great symbol in those days, \\nand every student had to procure fire and make offerings.  \\n \\nSo on the following day, Satyakama started for his Guru\\'s \\nhouse, and when in the evening he had performed his oblation,', 'and worshipped at the fire, and was  sitting near it, he heard a \\nvoice come from the fire, \"O Satyakama.\" \"Speak, Lord,\" said \\nSatyakama. (Perhaps you may remember a very similar story in \\nthe Old Testament, how Samuel heard a mysterious voice.) \"O \\nSatyakama, I am come to  teach you a little of Brahman. This \\nearth is a portion of that Brahman. The sky and the heaven are \\nportions of It. The ocean is a part of that Brahman.\" Then the', 'fire said that a certain bird would also teach him something. \\n \\nSatyakama continued his journey and on the next day when he \\nhad performed his evening sacrifice a swan came to him and \\nsaid, \"I will teach you something about Brahman. This fire', '27 \\n \\nwhich you worship, O Satyakama, is a part of that Brahman. \\nThe sun is a part, the moon is a part, the lightning is a part of \\nthat Brahman. A bird called Madgu will tell you more about it.\" \\nThe next evening that bird came, and a similar voice was heard \\nby Satyakama, \"I will tell you something about Brahman. \\nBreath is a part of Brahman, sight is a part, hearing is a part, the \\nmind is a part.\" Then the boy arrived at his teacher\\'s place and', 'presented himself before him with due reverence.  No sooner \\nhad the teacher seen this disciple  than he remarked:  \\n\"Satyakama, thy face shines like that of a knower of Brahman! \\nWho then has taught thee?\" \"Beings other than men,\" replied \\nSatyakama. \"But I wish that you should teach me, sir. For I have \\nheard from men like you that knowledge which is learnt from a \\nGuru alone leads to the supreme good.\" Then the sage taught \\nhim the same knowledge which he had received from the gods.', '\"And nothing was left out, yea, nothing was left out.\" Now, \\napart from the allegories of what the bull, the fire, and the birds \\ntaught, we see the tendency of the thought and the direction in \\nwhich it was going in those days.  \\n \\nThe great idea of which we here see the germ is that all these \\nvoices are inside  ourselves. As we understand these truths \\nbetter, we find that the voice is in our own heart, and the student \\nunderstood that all the time he was hearing the truth; but his', 'explanation was not correct. He  was interpreting the voice as \\ncoming from the external world, while all the time, it was within \\nhim. The second idea that we get is that of making the \\nknowledge of the Brahman practical. The world is  always \\nseeking the practical possibilities of religion, and we find in', '28 \\n \\nthese stories how it was becoming more and more practical \\nevery day. The truth was shown through everything with which \\nthe students were familiar. The fire they were worshipping was \\nBrahman, the earth was a part of Brahman, and so on. \\n \\nThe next story belongs to Upakosala Kâmalâyana, a disciple of \\nthis Satyakama, who went to be taught by him and dwelt with \\nhim for some time. No w Satyakama went away  on a journey, \\nand the student became very downhearted; and  when the', 'teacher\\'s wife came and asked him why he was not eating, the  \\nboy said, \"I am too unhappy to eat.\" Then a voice came from \\nthe fire he was worshipping, saying \"This life is Brahman, \\nBrahman is the ether, and Brahman is happiness. Know \\nBrahman.\" \"I know, sir,\" the boy replied, \"that life is Brahman, \\nbut that It is ethe r and happiness I do not know.\" Then it \\nexplained that the two words ether and happiness signified one \\nthing in reality, viz. the sentient ether (pure intelligence) that', 'resides in the heart. So, it taught him Brahman as life and as the \\nether in the heart.  \\n \\nThen the fire taught him, \"This earth, food, fire, and sun whom \\nyou worship, are forms of Brahman. The person that is seen in \\nthe sun, I am He. He who knows this and meditates on Him, all \\nhis sins vanish and he has long life and becomes happy. He who \\nlives in the cardinal points, the moon, the stars, and the water, I \\nam He. He who lives in this life, the ether, the heavens, and the', 'lightning, I am He.\" Here too we see the same idea of practical \\nreligion. The things which they were worshipping, such as the', '29 \\n \\nfire, the sun, the moon, and so forth, and the voice wi th which \\nthey were familiar, form the subject of the stories which explain \\nthem and give them a higher meaning. And this is the real, \\npractical side of Vedanta. It  does not destroy the world, but it \\nexplains it; it does not destroy the person, but explains  him; it \\ndoes not destroy the individuality, but  explains it by showing \\nthe real individuality. \\n \\nIt does not show that this world is vain and does not exist, but', 'it says, \"Understand what this world is, so that it may not hurt \\nyou.\" The voice did not say to Upakosala that the fire which he \\nwas worshipping, or the sun, or the moon, or the lightning, or \\nanything else, was all wrong, but it showed him that the same  \\nspirit which was inside the sun, and moon, and lightning, and \\nthe fire, and the earth, was in  him, so that everything became \\ntransformed, as it were, in the eyes of Upakosala. The fire which', 'was merely a material fire before, in which to make oblations, \\nassumed a new aspect and became the Lord. The earth became \\ntransformed, life became transformed, the sun, the moon, the \\nstars, the lightning, everything became transformed and deified. \\nTheir real nature was known. The theme of the Vedanta i s to \\nsee the Lord in everything, to see things in their real nature, not \\nas they appear to be.  \\n \\nThen another lesson is taught in the Upanishads: \"He who', 'shines through the eyes is Brahman; He is the Beautiful One, \\nHe is the Shining One. He shines in all these worlds.\" A certain \\npeculiar light, a commentator says, which comes to the pure', '30 \\n \\nman, is what is meant by the light in the eyes, and it is said that \\nwhen a man is pure such a light will shine in his eyes, and that \\nlight belongs really to the Soul within, which is everywhere. It \\nis the same light which shines in the planets, in the stars, and \\nsuns. I will now read to you some other doctrine of these ancient \\nUpanishads, about birth and death and so on. Perhaps it will \\ninterest you. Shvetaketu went to the king of the Panchâlas, and', 'the king asked him, \"Do you know where people go when they \\ndie? Do you know how they come back? Do you know why the \\nother world does not become full?\" The boy replied that he did \\nnot know. \\n \\nThen he went to his father and asked hi m the same questions. \\nThe father said, \"I  do not know,\" and he went to the king. The \\nking said that this knowledge was never known to the priests, it \\nwas only with the kings, and that was the reason why kings ruled', 'the world. This man stayed with the king for some time, for the \\nking said he would teach him. \"The other world, O Gautama, is \\nthe fire. The sun is its fuel. The rays are the smoke. The day is \\nthe flame. The moon is the embers. And the stars are the sparks. \\nIn this fire the gods pour libation of faith and from this libation \\nking Soma is born.\" So on he goes. \"You need not make oblation \\nto that little fire: the whole world is that fire, and this oblation,', 'this worship, is continually going on. The gods, and the angels, \\nand everybody is worshipping it. Man is the greatest symbol of \\nfire, the body of man.\" Here also we see the ideal  becoming \\npractical and Brahman is seen in everything.', '31 \\n \\nThe principle that underlies  all these stories is that invented \\nsymbolism may be good and helpful, but already better symbols \\nexist than any we can invent. You may invent an image through \\nwhich to worship God, but a better image already exists, the \\nliving man. You may build a temple in which to worship God, \\nand that may be good, but a better one, a much higher one,  \\nalready exists, the human body. You remember that the Vedas', 'have two parts, the ceremonial and the knowledge portions.  In \\ntime ceremonials had multiplied and become  so intricate that it \\nwas almost hopeless to disentangle them, and so in the \\nUpanishads we find that the ceremonials are almost done away \\nwith, but gently, by explaining them. We see that in old times \\nthey had these oblations and sacrifices, then the philosophers \\ncame, and instead of snatching away the symbols from the hands', 'of the ignorant, in stead of taking the negative position, which \\nwe unfortunately find so general in modern reforms, they gave \\nthem something to take their place. \\n \\n\"Here is the symbol of fire,\" they said. \"Very good! But here is \\nanother symbol, the earth. What a grand, great symbol! Here is \\nthis little temple, but the whole universe is a temple; a man can \\nworship anywhere. There are the peculiar figures that men draw \\non the earth, and there are the altars, but here is the greatest of', 'altars, the living, conscious human body, and to worship at this \\naltar is far higher than the worship  of any dead symbols.\" We \\nnow come to a peculiar doctrine.', '32 \\n \\nI do not understand much of it myself. If you can make \\nsomething out of it, I will read it to you. When a man dies, who \\nhas by meditation purified himself and got knowledge, he first \\ngoes to light, then from light to day, from day to the light half \\nof the moon, from that to the six months when the sun goes to \\nthe north, from that to the year, from the year to the sun, from \\nthe sun to the moon, from the moon to the lightning, and when', 'he comes to the sphere of lightning, he meets a person who is \\nnot human, and that person leads him to (the conditioned) \\nBrahman. This is the way of the gods. When sages and wise \\npersons die, they go that way and they do not return.  \\n \\nWhat is meant by this month and year, and all these things, no \\none understands clearly. Each one gives his own meaning, and \\nsome say it is all nonsense. What is meant by going to the world \\nof the moon and of the sun, and this person who comes to help', 'the soul after it has reached the sphere of lightning,  no one \\nknows. There is an idea among the Hindus that the moon is a \\nplace where life exists, and we shall see how life has come from \\nthere. Those that have not attained to knowledge, but have done \\ngood work in this life, first go, when they die, through smoke, \\nthen to night, then to the dark fifteen days, then to the six months \\nwhen the sun goes to the south, and from that they go to the', 'region of their forefathers, then to ether, then to the region of the \\nmoon, and there become the food of the gods, and later, are born \\nas gods and live there so long as their good works  will permit. \\nAnd when the  effect of the good work has been finished, they \\ncome back to earth by the same route. They first become ether,', '33 \\n \\nand then air, and then smoke, and then mist, then cloud, and then \\nfall upon the earth as raindrops; then they get into food, which \\nis eaten up by human beings, and finally become their children. \\nThose whose works have been very good take birth in good \\nfamilies, and those whose works have been bad take bad births, \\neven in animal bodies.  \\n \\nAnimals are continually coming to and going from this earth. \\nThat is why the earth is neither full nor empty. Several ideas we', 'can get also from this, and later on, perhaps, we shall be able to \\nunderstand it better, and we can speculate a little upon what it \\nmeans. The last part which deals with how those who have been \\nin heaven return, is clearer, perhaps, than the first part; but the \\nwhole idea seems to be this that there is no permanent heaven \\nwithout realising God. Now some people who have not realised \\nGod, but have done good work in this world, with the view of', 'enjoying the results, go, when they die, th rough this and that \\nplace, until they reach heaven, and there they are born in the \\nsame way as we are here, as children of the gods, and they live \\nthere as long as their good works will permit.  \\n \\nOut of this comes one basic idea of the Vedanta that everything \\nwhich has name and form is transient. This earth is transient, \\nbecause it has name and form, and so the heavens must be  \\ntransient, because there also name and form remain. A heaven', 'which is eternal will be contradictory in terms, because \\neverything that has name and form must begin in time, exist in \\ntime, and end in time. These are settled doctrines of the Vedanta,', '34 \\n \\nand as such the heavens are given up. We have seen in the \\nSamhitâ that the idea of heaven was that it was eternal, much \\nthe same as is prevalent among Mohammedans and Christians.  \\n \\nThe Mohammedans concretize it a little more. They say it is a \\nplace where there are gardens, beneath which rivers run. In the \\ndesert of Arabia water is  very desirable, so the Mohammedan \\nalways conceives of his heaven as containing much water. I was', 'born in a country where there are six months of rain every year. \\nI should think of hea ven, I suppose, as a dry place, and so also \\nwould the English people. These heavens in the Samhita are \\neternal, and the departed have beautiful bodies and live with \\ntheir forefathers, and are happy ever afterwards. There they \\nmeet with their parents, children, and other relatives, and lead \\nvery much the same sort of life as here, only much happier. All', 'the difficulties and obstructions to happiness in this life have \\nvanished, and only its good parts and enjoyments remain. But \\nhowever comfortable mankind may consider this state of things, \\ntruth is one thing and comfort is another. There are cases where \\ntruth is not comfortable until we reach its climax. Human nature \\nis very conservative . It does something, and having once  done \\nthat, finds it hard to get out of it. The mind will not receive new \\nthoughts, because they bring discomfort.', 'thoughts, because they bring discomfort. \\n \\nIn the Upanishads, we see a tremendous departure made. It is \\ndeclared that these heavens in which men live with the ancestors \\nafter death cannot be permanent, seeing that ev erything which \\nhas name and form must die. If there are heavens with forms,', '35 \\n \\nthese heavens must  vanish in course of time; they  may last  \\nmillions of years, but there must  come a time when they will \\nhave to go. With this idea came another that these souls must \\ncome back to earth, and that heavens are places where they \\nenjoy the results of their good works, and after these effects are \\nfinished they come back into this earth life again. One thing is \\nclear from this that mankind had a perception of the philosophy', 'of causation even at the early time. Later on we shall see how \\nour philosophers bring that out in the language of philosophy \\nand logic, but here it is almost in the language of children. One \\nthing you may remark in reading these books that it is all internal \\nperception. \\n \\nIf you ask me if this can be practical, my answer is, it has been \\npractical first, and philosophical next. You can see that first \\nthese things have been perceived and realised and then written.', 'This world spoke to the early thinkers. Bi rds spoke to them, \\nanimals spoke to them, the sun and the moon spoke to them; and \\nlittle by little they realised things, and got into the heart of \\nnature. Not by cogitation not by the force of logic, not by \\npicking the brains of others and making a big book, as is the \\nfashion in modern times, not  even as I do, by taking up one of \\ntheir writings and making a long lecture, but by patient', 'investigation and discovery they found out the truth. Its essential \\nmethod was practice, and so it must be always. \\n \\nReligion is ever a practical science, and there never was nor will \\nbe any theological religion. It is practice first, and knowledge', '36 \\n \\nafterwards. The idea that souls come back is already there. \\nThose persons who do good work with the idea of  a result, get \\nit, but the result is not permanent. There we get the idea of \\ncausation very beautifully put forward, that the effect is  only \\ncommensurate with the cause. As the cause is, so the effect will \\nbe. The cause being finite, the effect must be finite. If the cause \\nis eternal the effect  can be eternal, but  all these causes, doing', 'good work, and all other things, are only finite causes, and as \\nsuch cannot produce infinite result.  \\n \\nWe now come to the other side of the question. As there cannot \\nbe an eternal heaven, on the same grounds, there cannot be an \\neternal hell. Suppose I am a very wicked man, doing evil every \\nminute of my life. Still, my whole life here, compared with my \\neternal life, is nothing. If there be an eternal punishment, it will \\nmean that there is an infinite effect produced by a finite cause,', 'which cannot be. If I do good all my life, I cannot have an \\ninfinite heaven; it would be making the same mistake. But there \\nis a third course which applies to those who have known the \\nTruth, to those who have realised It. This is the only way to get \\nbeyond this veil of Mâyâ — to realise what Truth is;  and the \\nUpanishads indicate what is meant by realising the Truth. \\n \\nIt means recognising neither good nor bad, but knowing all as', 'coming from the Self; Self is in eve rything. It means denying \\nthe universe; shutting your eyes to it; seeing the Lord in hell as \\nwell as in heaven; seeing the Lord in death as well as in life. This \\nis the line of thought in the passage I have read to you; the earth', '37 \\n \\nis a symbol of the Lord, the sky is the Lord, the place we fill is  \\nthe Lord, everything is Brahman. And this is to be seen, realised, \\nnot simply talked or thought about. We can see as its logical \\nconsequence that when the soul has realised that everything is \\nfull of the Lord, of Brahman, it will not care whether it goes to \\nheaven, or hell, or anywhere else; whether it be born again on \\nthis earth or in heaven. These things have ceased  to have any', 'meaning to that soul, because every place is the  same, every \\nplace is the temple of the Lord, every place has become holy and \\nthe presence of the Lord is all that it sees in heaven, or hell, or \\nanywhere else. Neither good nor bad, neither  life nor death — \\nonly the one infinite Brahman exists. \\n \\nAccording to the Vedanta, when a man has arrived  at that \\nperception, he has become  free, and he is the only man who is \\nfit to live in this world. Others are not. The man who sees evil,', 'how can he live in this world? His life is a mass of misery. The \\nman who sees dangers, his life is  a misery; the man who sees \\ndeath, his life is a misery. That man alone can live in this world, \\nhe alone can say, \"I enjoy this life, and I am happy in this life\". \\nwho has seen the Truth, and the Truth in everything. By the by, \\nI may tell you that the idea of hell does not occur in the Vedas \\nanywhere. It comes with the Purânas much later.', 'The worst punishment according to the Vedas is coming back to \\nearth, having another chance in this world. From the very first  \\nwe see the idea is taking the impersonal turn.  The ideas of \\npunishment and reward are very material, and they are only', '38 \\n \\nconsonant with the idea of a human God, who loves one and \\nhates another, just as we do. Punishment and reward are only \\nadmissible with the existence of such a God.  \\n \\nThey had such a God in the Samhita, and there we find the idea \\nof fear entering, but as soon as we come to the Upanishads, the \\nidea of fear vanishes, and the impersonal idea takes its place. It \\nis naturally the hardest thing for man to understand, this \\nimpersonal idea, for he is always clinging on to the person. Even', 'people who are thought to be great thinkers get disgusted at the \\nidea of the Impersonal God. But to me it seems so absurd to \\nthink of God as an embodied man. Which is the higher idea, a \\nliving God, or a dead God? A God whom nobody sees, nobody \\nknows, or a God Known? The Impersonal God is a living God, \\na principle. The difference between personal and impersonal is \\nthis, that the personal is only a man, and the impersonal idea is', 'that He is the angel, the man, the animal, and yet something more \\nwhich we cannot see, because impersonality includes all \\npersonalities, is the sum total of everything in the universe, and \\ninfinitely more besides. \"As the one fire coming into the world \\nis manifesting itself in so many forms, and yet is infinitely more \\nbesides,\" so is the Impersonal. We want to worship a living God. \\nI have seen nothing but God all my life, nor have you. To see', 'this chair you first see God, and then the chair in and through \\nHim. He is everywhere saying, \"I am\". The moment you feel \"I \\nam\", you are conscious of Existence.', '39 \\n \\nWhere shall we go to find God if we cannot see Him in our own \\nhearts and in every living being? \"Thou art the man, Thou art the \\nwoman, Thou art the girl, and Thou art the boy. Thou art the old \\nman tottering with a stick. \\n \\nThou art the young man walking in the pride of his strength.\" \\nThou art all that exists, a wonderful living God who is the only \\nfact in the universe. This seems to many to be a terrible \\ncontradiction to the traditional God who lives  behind a veil', 'somewhere and whom nobody  ever sees. The priests only give \\nus an assurance that if we follow them, listen to their \\nadmonitions, and walk in the way they mark out for us — then \\nwhen we die, they will give us a passport to enable us to see the \\nface of God! What are all these heaven ideas but simply \\nmodifications of this nonsensical priestcraft? Of course the \\nimpersonal idea is very destructive, it takes away all trade from \\nthe priests, churches, and temples. In India there is a famine', \"now, but there are temples in each one of which there are jewels \\nworth a king's ransom! If the priests taught this Impersonal idea \\nto the people, their occupation would be  gone. Yet we have to \\nteach it unselfishly, without priestcraft. \\n \\nYou are God and so am I; who obeys whom? Who worships \\nwhom? You are the highest temple of God; I would rathe r\\n \\nworship you than any temple, image, or Bible. Why are some \\npeople so contradictory in their thought? They are like fish\", 'slipping through our fingers. They say they are hard -headed \\npractical men. Very good. But what is more practical than', '40 \\n \\nworshipping here, worshipping you? I see you, feel you, and I \\nknow you are God. The Mohammedan says, there is no God but \\nAllah. The Vedanta says, there is nothing that is not God. It may \\nfrighten many of you, but you will understand it by degrees.  \\n \\nThe living God is within you, and yet you are building churches \\nand temples and believing all sorts of imaginary nonsense. The \\nonly God to worship is the human soul  in the human body. Of', 'course all animals are temples too, but man is the highest, the \\nTaj Mahal of temples. If I ca nnot worship  in that, no other  \\ntemple will be of any advantage. The moment I have realised \\nGod sitting in the temple of every human body, the moment I \\nstand in reverence before every human being and see God in \\nhim — that moment I am free from bondage, ever ything that \\nbinds vanishes, and I am free. \\n \\nThis is the most practical of all worship. It has nothing to do', 'with theorising and speculation. Yet it frightens many. They say \\nit is not right. They go on theorising about old ideals told them \\nby their grandfathers, that a God somewhere in heaven had told \\nsome one that he was God. Since that time we have only \\ntheories. This is practicality according to them, and our ideas are \\nimpractical! No doubt, the Vedanta says that each one must have \\nhis own path, but the path is not the goal. \\n \\nThe worship of a God in heaven and all these things are not bad,', 'but they are only steps towards the Truth and not the Truth itself. \\nThey are good and beautiful, and some wonderful ideas are', '41 \\n \\nthere, but the Vedanta says at every point, \"My friend, Him \\nwhom you are worshiping as unknown, I worship as thee. He \\nwhom you are worshipping as unknown and are seeking for, \\nthroughout the universe, has been with you all the time. You are \\nliving through Him, and He is the Eternal Witness of the \\nuniverse.\" \"He whom all the Vedas worship, nay, more, He who \\nis always present in the eternal \\'I\\'. He existing, the whole', 'universe exists. He is the light and life of the universe. If the \\'I\\' \\nwere not in you, you would not see the sun, everything would \\nbe a dark mass. He shining, you see the world.\" One question is \\ngenerally asked, and it is this that this may lead to a tremendous \\namount of difficulty. \\n \\nEvery one of us will think, \"I am God, and whatever I do or \\nthink must be good, for God can do no evil.\" In the first place, \\neven taking this danger of misinterpretation for granted, can it', 'be proved that on the other side the same danger does not exist? \\nThey have been  worshipping a God in heaven separate from \\nthem, and of whom they are much afraid. They have been born \\nshaking with fear, and all their life they will go on shaking. Has \\nthe world been made much better by this? Those who have \\nunderstood and worshipped a Personal God, and those who have \\nunderstood and worshipped an Impersonal God, on which side \\nhave been the great workers of the world — gigantic workers,', 'gigantic moral powers? Certainly, on the Impersonal. How can \\nyou expect morality to be developed through fear? It can never \\nbe. \"Where one sees another, where one hears another, that is \\nMaya. When one does not see another, when one does not hear', '42 \\n \\nanother, when  everything has become  the Atman, who sees \\nwhom, who perceives whom?\" It is all He, and all I, at the same \\ntime.  \\n \\nThe soul has become pure. Then, and then alone we understand \\nwhat love is.  Love cannot come through fear, its basis is  \\nfreedom. When we really begin to love the world, then we \\nunderstand what is meant by brotherhood or mankind, and not \\nbefore. So, it is not right to say that the Impersonal idea will lead', 'to a tremendous amount of evil in the world, as if the other \\ndoctrine never lent itself to works of evil, as if it did not lead to \\nsectarianism deluging the world with blood and causing men to \\ntear each other to pieces. \"My God is the greatest God, let us \\ndecide it by a free fight.\" That is the outcome of dualism all over \\nthe world. \\n \\nCome out into the broad open light of day, come out from the \\nlittle narrow paths, for how can the infinite soul rest content to', 'live and die in small ruts? Come out into the universe of Light. \\nEverything in the universe is yours, stretch out your arms and \\nembrace it with love. If you ever felt you wanted to do that, you \\nhave felt God. You remember that passage in th e sermon of \\nBuddha, how he sent a thought of love towards the south, the \\nnorth, the east, and the west, above and below, until the whole \\nuniverse was filled with this lose, so grand, great, and infinite.', 'When you have that feeling, you have true personality.', '43 \\n \\nThe whole universe is  one person; let go the little things. Give  \\nup the small for the Infinite, give up small enjoyments  for \\ninfinite bliss.  It is all yours, for the Impersonal includes the \\nPersonal. So, God is Personal and Impersonal at the same time. \\nAnd Man, the Infinite, Impersonal Man, is manifesting Himself \\nas person. We the infinite have limited ourselves, as it were, into \\nsmall parts. The Vedanta says that Infinity  is our true nature; it', 'will never vanish, it will abide forever. But we are limiting \\nourselves by our Karma, which like a chain round our necks has \\ndragged us into this limitation. Break that chain and be free. \\n \\nTrample law under your feet. There is no law in human nature, \\nthere is no destiny, no fate. How can there be law in infinity? \\nFreedom is its watchword.

And what makes this difference?  \\n \\nThe one is free and the other is bound. The actor knows his \\nbeggary is not true, but that he has assumed it for play, while the', 'real beggar thinks that it is his too familiar state and that he has \\nto bear it whether he wills it or not.

Give up all these mad pursuits, and then \\nplay your part in the universe, as an actor on the stage. The\", '45 \\n \\nwhole vision is changed, and instead of  an eternal prison this  \\nworld has become a playground; instead of  a land of  \\ncompetition it is a land of bliss, where there is perpetual spring, \\nflowers b loom and butterflies flit about. This very world \\nbecomes heaven, which formerly was hell. To the eyes of the \\nbound it is a tremendous place of torment, but to the eyes of the \\nfree it is quite otherwise. \\n \\n This one life is the universal life, heavens and all those places', 'are here. All the gods are here, the prototypes of man. The gods \\ndid not create man after their type, but man created gods. And \\nhere are the prototypes, here is Indra, here is Varuna, and all the \\ngods of the universe. We have been projecting our little doubles, \\nand we are the originals of these gods, we are the real, the only \\ngods to be worshipped. This is the view of the Vedanta, and this \\nits practicality. When we have become free, we need not go mad', 'and throw up society and rush off to die in the forest or the cave; \\nwe shall remain where we were, only we shall  understand the \\nwhole thing. \\n \\nThe same phenomena will remain, but with a new meaning. We \\ndo not know the world yet; it is only through freedom that we \\nsee what it is, and understand  its nature. We shall see then that \\nthis so -called law, or fate, or destiny occupied only an \\ninfinitesimal part of our nature. It was only one side, but on the', 'other side there was freedom all the time. We did not know this, \\nand that is why we have been trying to save ourselves from evil \\nby hiding our faces in the ground, like the hunted hare. Through', '46 \\n \\ndelusion we have been trying to forget our nature, and yet we \\ncould not; it was always calling upon us, and all our search after \\nGod or gods, or external free dom, was a search after our real \\nnature. We mistook the voice. We thought it was from the fire, \\nor from a god or the sun, or moon, or stars, but at last we have \\nfound that it was from within ourselves. Within ourselves is this \\neternal voice speaking of eternal freedom; its music is eternally', 'going on. Part of this music of the Soul has become the earth, \\nthe law, this universe, but it was always ours and always will be. \\nIn one word, the ideal of Vedanta is to know man as he really is, \\nand this is its message, that if you cannot worship your brother \\nman, the manifested God, how can you worship a God who is \\nunmanifested? Do you not remember what the Bible says, \"If  \\nyou cannot love your brother whom you have seen, how can you', 'love God whom you have not se en?\" If you cannot see  God in \\nthe human face, how can you see him in the clouds, or in images \\nmade of dull, dead matter, or in mere fictitious stories of our \\nbrain? I shall call you religious from the day you begin to see \\nGod in men and women, and then you  will understand what is \\nmeant by turning the left cheek  to the man who strikes you on \\nthe right. When you see man as God, everything, even the tiger, \\nwill be welcome.', 'will be welcome. \\n \\nWhatever comes to you is but the Lord, the Eternal, the Blessed \\nOne, appearing to us in various forms, as our father, and mother, \\nand friend, and child — they are our own soul playing  with us. \\nAs our human relationships can thus be made divine, so our \\nrelationship with God may take any of these forms and we can', '47 \\n \\nlook upon Him as our father, o r mother, or friend, or beloved. \\nCalling God Mother is  a higher ideal than calling Him Father; \\nand to call Him Friend is still higher; but the highest is to regard \\nHim as the Beloved. The highest point of all is to see no \\ndifference between lover and beloved. You may  remember, \\nperhaps, the old Persian story, of how a lover came and knocked \\nat the door of the beloved and was asked, \"Who are you?\" He', 'answered, \"It is I\", and there was no response. A second time he \\ncame, and exclaimed, \"I am here\", but the door was not opened. \\nThe third time he came, and the voice asked from inside, \"Who \\nis there?\" He replied \"I am thyself, my beloved\", and the door \\nopened. So is the relation between God and ourselves. He is in \\neverything, He is everything.  \\n \\nEvery man and woman is the palpable, blissful, living God. Who \\nsays God is unknown? Who says He is to be searched after? We', 'have found God eternally. We have been living in Him \\neternally; everywhere He is eternally known, eternally \\nworshipped. Then comes another idea, that other forms of \\nworship are not errors. This is one of the great points to be \\nremembered, that those who worship God through  ceremonials \\nand forms, however crude we may think them to be, are not in \\nerror. \\n \\nIt is the journey from truth to truth, from lower truth to higher \\ntruth. Darkness is less light; evil is  less good; impurity is less', 'purity. It must always be borne in mind that we should see others \\nwith eyes of love, with sympathy, knowing that they are going', '48 \\n \\nalong the same path that we have trodde n. If you are free, you \\nmust know that all will be so sooner or later, and if you are free, \\nhow can you see the impermanent? If you are really pure, how \\ndo you see the impure? For what is within, is without.  \\n \\nWe cannot see impurity without having it inside ourselves. This \\nis one of the practical sides of Vedanta, and I hope that we shall \\nall try to carry it into our lives. Our whole life here is to carry', 'this into practice, but the one great point we gain is that we shall \\nwork with satisfaction and content ment, instead of with \\ndiscontent and dissatisfaction, for we know that Truth is within \\nus, we have It as our birthright, and we have only to manifest It, \\nand make It tangible.', '49 \\n \\n \\nPart - 3 \\n(Delivered in London, 17th November 1896) \\n \\nIn the Chhâdogya Upanishad we read that a sage called Nârada \\ncame to another called Sanatkumâra, and asked him various \\nquestions, of which one was, if religion was the cause of things \\nas they are. And Sanatkumara leads him, as it were, step by step, \\ntelling him that there is something higher than this earth, and \\nsomething higher than that, and so on, till he comes to Âkâsha,', 'ether. Ether is higher than light, because in the ether are the sun \\nand the moon, lightning and the stars; in ether we live, and in \\nether we die.  \\n \\nThen the question arises, if there is anything higher than that, \\nand Sanatkumara tells him of  Prâna. This Prana, according to \\nthe Vedanta, is the principle of life. It is like ether, an \\nomnipresent principle; and all motion,  either in the body or \\nanywhere else, is the work of this Prana. It is greater than', 'Akasha, and through it everything lives. Prana is in the mother, \\nin the father, in the sister, in the teacher, Prana is the knower. I \\nwill read another passage, where Shvetaketu asks his father \\nabout the Truth, and the father teaches him different things, and \\nconcludes by saying, \"That which is  the fine cause in all these \\nthings, of It are all these things made.', '50 \\n \\nThat is the All, that is Truth, thou art That, O Shvetaketu.\" And \\nthen he g ives various examples. \"As a bee, O Shvetaketu, \\ngathers honey from different flowers, and as the different \\nhoneys do not know that they are from various trees, and from \\nvarious flowers, so all of us, having come to that Existence, \\nknow not that we have don e so. Now, that  which is that subtle \\nessence, in It all that exists has its self. It is the True. It is the Self', 'and thou, O Shvetaketu, are That.\" He gives another example of \\nthe rivers running down to the ocean. \"As the rivers, when they \\nare in the ocean, do not know that they have been various rivers, \\neven so when we come out of that Existence, we do not know \\nthat we are That. O Shvetaketu, thou art That.\" So on he goes \\nwith his teachings. \\n \\nNow there are two principles of knowledge. The one principle \\nis that we know by referring the particular to the general, and', 'the general to the universal; and the second is that anything of \\nwhich the explanation is sought is to be explained so far as \\npossible from its own nature. Taking up the first princi ple, we \\nsee that all our knowledge really consists of classifications, \\ngoing higher and higher. When something happens singly, we \\nare, as it were, dissatisfied. When it can be shown that the same \\nthing happens again and again, we are satisfied and call it law.', 'When we find that one apple falls, we are dissatisfied; but when \\nwe find that all apples fall, we call it the law of gravitation and \\nare satisfied.', '51 \\n \\nThe fact is that from the particular we deduce the general. When \\nwe want to study religion, we shoul d apply this scientific \\nprocess. The same principle also holds good here, and as a fact \\nwe find that that has been the method all through. In reading \\nthese books from which  I have been translating to you, the \\nearliest idea that I can trace is this principle of going from the \\nparticular to the general. We see how the \"bright ones\" became', 'merged into one  principle; and likewise in  the ideas of the \\ncosmos we find the ancient thinkers going higher and higher — \\nfrom the fine elements they go to finer and  more embracing \\nelements, and from these particulars they come to one \\nomnipresent ether, and from that even they go to an all \\nembracing force, or  Prana; and through all this runs the \\nprinciple, that one is not separate from the others.  \\n \\nIt is the very ether that exists in the higher form of Prana, or the', 'higher form of Prana concretes,  so to say, and becomes ether; \\nand that ether becomes still grosser, and so on. The \\ngeneralization of the Personal God is another case in point. We \\nhave seen how this gene ralization was reached, and was called \\nthe sum total of all consciousness. But a difficulty arises — it is \\nan incomplete generalization. We take up only one side of the \\nfacts of nature, the fact of consciousness, and upon that we', 'generalize, but the other side is left out. So, in the first place it \\nis a defective generalization. There is another insufficiency, and \\nthat relates to the second principle.', '52 \\n \\nEverything should be explained from its own nature. There may \\nhave been people who thought that every ap ple that fell to the \\nground was dragged down by a ghost, but the explanation is the \\nlaw of gravitation; and although we know it is  not a perfect \\nexplanation, yet it is much better than the other, because it is \\nderived from the nature of the thing itself, while the other posits \\nan extraneous cause. So, throughout the whole range of our', 'knowledge; the explanation which is based upon the nature of \\nthe thing itself ; is a scientific explanation, and an explanation \\nwhich brings in an outside agent is unscientific. \\n \\nSo, the explanation of a Personal God as the creator of the \\nuniverse has to stand that test. If that God is outside of nature, \\nhaving nothing to do with nature, and this nature is the outcome \\nof the command of that God and produced from nothing, it is a', 'very unscientific theory, and this has been the weak point of \\nevery Theistic religion throughout the ages. \\n \\nThese two defects we find in what is generally called the theory \\nof monotheism, the theory of a Personal God, with all the \\nqualities of a human bei ng multiplied very much, who, by His \\nwill, created this universe out of nothing and yet is separate from \\nit. This leads us into two difficulties. As we have seen, it is not a', 'sufficient generalization, and secondly, it is not an explanation \\nof nature from nature. It holds that the effect is\\n \\nnot the cause, that \\nthe cause is entirely separate from the effect. Yet all  human \\nknowledge shows that the effect is but the cause in another form. \\nTo this idea the discoveries of modern science are tending every', '53 \\n \\nday, and the latest theory that has been accepted  on all sides is \\nthe theory of evolution, the principle of which is that the effect \\nis but the cause in another form, a readjustment of the cause, and \\nthe cause takes the form of the effect. The theory of creation out \\nof nothing would be laughed at by modern scientists. Now, can \\nreligion stand these tests?  If there  be any religious theories  \\nwhich can stand these two  tests, they will be acceptable to the', 'modern mind, to the thinking mind. Any other theory which we \\nask the modern man to believe,  on the authority of priests, or \\nchurches, or books, he is unable to accept, and the result is a \\nhideous mass of unbelief. \\n \\nEven in those in whom there is an external display of belief, in \\ntheir hearts there is a tremendous am ount of unbelief. The rest \\nshrink away from religion, as it were, give it up, regarding it as \\npriestcraft only. Religion has been reduced to a sort of national', 'form. It is one of our very best social remnants; let it remain. \\nBut the real necessity which the grandfather of the modern man \\nfelt for it is gone; he no longer finds it satisfactory to his reason. \\nThe idea of such a Personal God, and such a creation, the idea \\nwhich is generally known as monotheism in every religion, \\ncannot hold its own any longer . In India, it could not hold its \\nown because of the Buddhists, and that was the very point where', 'they gained their victory in ancient times. They showed that if \\nwe allow that nature is possessed of infinite power, and that \\nnature can work out all its want s, it is simply unnecessary to \\ninsist that there is something besides nature.', '54 \\n \\nEven the soul is unnecessary. The discussion about substance \\nand qualities is very old, and you will sometimes find that the \\nold superstition lives even at the present day. Most of you have \\nread how, during the Middle Ages, and, I am sorry to say, e ven \\nmuch later, this was one of the subjects of discussion, whether \\nqualities adhered to substance, whether length, breadth, and \\nthickness adhered to the substance which we call dead matter,', 'whether, the substance remaining, the qualities are there or not. \\nTo this our Buddhist says, \"You have no ground for maintaining \\nthe existence of such a substance; the qualities are all that exist; \\nyou do not see beyond them.\"  \\n \\nThis is just the position of most of our modern agnostics. For it \\nis this fight of the substance and qualities that, on a higher plane, \\ntakes the form of the fight between noumenon and phenomenon. \\nThere is the phenomenal world, the universe of continuous', 'change, and there is something behind which does not change; \\nand this duality of existence, noumenon and phenomenon, some \\nhold, is true, and others with better reason claim that you have \\nno right to admit the two, for what we see, feel, and think is only \\nthe phenomenon. You have no right to assert there is anything \\nbeyond phenomenon; and there is no answer to this. The only \\nanswer we get is from the monistic theory of the Vedanta. It is', 'true that only one exists, and that one is either phenomenon or \\nnoumenon. It is not true that there are two — something \\nchanging, and, in and through that, something which does not \\nchange; but it is the one and the same thing which appears as \\nchanging, and which is in reality unchangeable.', '55 \\n \\n \\nWe have come to think of the body, and mind, and soul as many, \\nbut really there is only one; and that one is appearing in all these \\nvarious forms. Take the well- known illustration of the monists, \\nthe rope appearing as the snake. Some people, in the dark or \\nthrough some other cause, mistake the rope for the snake, but \\nwhen knowledge comes, the snake vanishes and it is found to be \\na rope. By this illustration we see that when the snake exists in', 'the mind, the rope has vanished, and when the rope exists, the \\nsnake has gone. When we see phenomenon, and phenomenon \\nonly, around us, the noumenon has vanished, but \\nwhen we see the noumenon, the unchangeable, it naturally \\nfollows that the phenomenon has vanished. Now, we understand \\nbetter the position of both the realist and the idealist. The realist \\nsees the phenomenon only, and the idealist looks to the \\nnoumenon.', 'noumenon.  \\n \\nFor the idealist, the really genuine idealist, who has truly arrived \\nat the power of perception, whereby he can get away from all \\nideas of change, for him the changeful universe has vanished, \\nand he has the right to say it is all delusion, there is no change. \\nThe realist at the same time looks  at the changeful. For him the \\nunchangeable has vanished, and he has a right to say this is all \\nreal. What is the outcome of this philosophy? It is that the idea', 'of Personal God is not sufficient. We have to get to something \\nhigher, to the Impersonal idea. It is the only logical step that we \\ncan take.', '56 \\n \\nNot that the personal idea would be destroyed by that, not that \\nwe supply proof that the Personal God does not exist, but we \\nmust go to the Impersonal for the explanation of the personal, \\nfor the Impersonal is a much higher generalization than the \\npersonal. The Impersonal only can be Infinite, the personal is \\nlimited. Thus, we preserve the personal and do not destroy it. \\n \\nOften the doubt comes to us that if we arrive at the idea of the', 'Impersonal God, the personal will be destroyed, if we arrive at \\nthe idea of the Impersonal man, the personal will be lost. But \\nthe Vedantic idea is not the destruction of the individual, but its \\nreal preservation. We cannot prove the individual by any other \\nmeans but by referring to the universal, by proving that this \\nindividual is really the universal. If we think of the individual as \\nseparate from everything else in the universe, it cannot stand a \\nminute. Such a thing never existed.', 'minute. Such a thing never existed. \\n \\nSecondly, by the  application of the second  principle, that the \\nexplanation of everything must come out of the nature of the \\nthing, we are led to a still bolder idea, and one more difficult to \\nunderstand. It is nothing less than this, that the Impersonal \\nBeing, our highest generalization, is in ourselves, and we are \\nThat. \"O Shvetaketu, thou art That.\" You are that Impersonal \\nBeing; that God for whom you have been searching all over the', 'universe is all the time yourself — yourself not in the personal \\nsense but in the Impersonal. The man we know now, the \\nmanifested, is personalised, but the reality of this is the \\nImpersonal. To understand the personal, we have to refer it to', '57 \\n \\nthe Impersonal, the particular; must be referred to; the general, \\nand that Impersonal is the Truth, the Self of man. There will be \\nvarious questions in connection with this, and I  shall try to \\nanswer them as we go on. Many difficulties will arise, but first \\nlet us clearly understand the position of monism. As manifested \\nbeings we appear to be separate, but our reality is one, and the \\nless we think of ourselves as separate from that One, the better', 'for us. The more we think of ourselves a s separate from the \\nWhole, the more miserable we become. \\n \\nFrom this monistic principle we get at the basis of ethics, and I \\nventure to say that we cannot get any ethics from anywhere else. \\nWe know that the oldest idea of ethics was the will of some \\nparticular being or beings, but few are ready to accept that now, \\nbecause it would be only a partial generalization. \\n \\nThe Hindus say we must not do this or that because the Vedas', 'say so, but the Christian is not going to obey the authority of the \\nVedas. Th e Christian says you must do this and not do that \\nbecause the Bible says so. That will not be binding on those who \\ndo not believe in the Bible. But we must have a theory which is \\nlarge enough to take in all these various grounds. \\n \\nJust as there are million s of people who are ready to believe  in \\na Personal Creator, there have also been thousands of the', 'brightest minds in this world who felt that such ideas were not \\nsufficient for them, and wanted something higher, and wherever \\nreligion was not broad enough to include all these minds, the', '58 \\n \\nresult was that the brightest  minds in society were  always \\noutside of religion; and never was this so marked as at the present \\ntime, especially in Europe.  \\n \\nTo include these minds, therefore, religion must become broad \\nenough. Everything it claims must be judged from the \\nstandpoint of reason.  Why religions should claim that they are \\nnot bound to abide by the standpoint of reason, no one knows. \\nIf one does not take the standard of reason, there cannot be any', 'true judgement, even in the case of religions. One religion may \\nordain something very hideous. \\n \\nFor instance, the Mohammedan religion allows Mohammedans \\nto kill all who are not of their religion. It is clearly stated in the \\nKoran, \"Kill the infidels if they do not become Mohammedans.\" \\nThey must be put to fire and sword. Now if we tell a \\nMohammedan that this is wrong, he will naturally ask, \"How do \\nyou know that? How do you know it is not good? My book says', 'it is.\" If you say your book is older, there will come the Buddhist, \\nand say, my book is much older still. Then will come the Hindu, \\nand say, my books are the oldest of all. Therefore, referring to \\nbooks will not do.  \\n \\nWhere is the standard by which you can compare? You will say, \\nlook at the Sermon on the Mount, and the Mohammedan will \\nreply, look at the Ethics of the Koran. The Mohammedan will \\nsay, who is the arbiter as  to which is the better of the two?', 'Neither the New Testament nor the Koran can be the arbiter in', '59 \\n \\na quarrel between them. There must be some independent \\nauthority, and that cannot be any book, but something which is \\nuniversal; and what is more universal than reason? It has been  \\nsaid that reason is not strong enough; it does not always\\n \\nhelp us \\nto get at the Truth; many times, it makes mistakes, and, \\ntherefore, the conclusion is that we must believe in the authority \\nof a church! That was said to me by a Roman Catholic,  but I', 'could not see the logic of it. On the other hand I should say, if \\nreason be so weak, a body of priests would be weaker, and I am \\nnot going to accept their verdict, but I will abide by my reason, \\nbecause with all its weakness there is some chance of my getting \\nat truth through it; while, by the other means, there is no such \\nhope at all. We should, therefore,  follow reason and also \\nsympathise with those who do not come to any sort of belief, \\nfollowing reason.', 'following reason. \\n \\nFor it is better that mankind should become atheist by following \\nreason than blindly believe in two hundred million of gods on \\nthe authority of anybody.  What we want is progress, \\ndevelopment, realisation. No theories ever made men higher. No \\namount of books can help us to become purer. The only power \\nis in realisation, and that lies in ourselves and comes from \\nthinking. Let men think. A clod of earth never thinks; but it', 'remains only a lump of earth. The glory of man is that he is a \\nthinking being. It is the nature of man to think and therein he \\ndiffers from animals. I believe in reason and follow reason  \\nhaving seen enough of the evils of authority, for I was born in a \\ncountry where they have gone to the extreme of authority.', '60 \\n \\n \\nThe Hindus believe that creation has come out of the Vedas. \\nHow do you know there is a cow? Because the word cow is  in \\nthe Vedas. How do you know there is a man outside? Because \\nthe word man is there. If it had not been, there would have been \\nno man outside. That is what they say. Authority with a \\nvengeance! And it is not studied as I have studied it, but some \\nof the most powerful minds have taken it up  and spun out', 'wonderful logical theories round it. They have reasoned it out, \\nand there it stands — a whole system of philosophy;  and \\nthousands of the brightest intellects hare been dedicated through \\nthousands of years to the working out of this theory. Such has \\nbeen the power of authority, and great are the dangers thereof. \\nIt stunts the growth of humanity, and we must not forget that we \\nwant growth. Even in all relative truth, more than the truth itself, \\nwe want the exercise.', 'we want the exercise.  \\n \\nThat is our life. The monistic theory has this merit  that it is the \\nmost rational of all the religious theories that we can conceive \\nof. Every other theory, every conception of God which is partial \\nand little and personal is not rational. And yet monism has this \\ngrandeur that it embraces all these partial c onceptions of God \\nas being necessary for many. Some people say that this personal \\nexplanation is irrational. But it is consoling; they want a', 'consoling religion and we understand that it is necessary for \\nthem. The clear light of truth very few in this life can bear, much \\nless live up to. It is necessary, therefore, that this comfortable \\nreligion should exist; it helps many souls to a better one. Small', '61 \\n \\nminds whose circumference is very limited and which require \\nlittle things to build them up, never venture t o soar high in \\nthought. Their conceptions are very good and helpful to them, \\neven if only of little gods and symbols.  \\n \\nBut you have to  understand the Impersonal, for  it is in  and \\nthrough that alone that these others can be explained. Take, for \\ninstance, the idea of a Personal God. A man who understands \\nand believes in the Impersonal — John Stuart Mill, for example', '— may say that a Personal God is impossible, and cannot  be \\nproved. I admit with him that a Personal God cannot be \\ndemonstrated. But He is the h ighest reading of the Impersonal \\nthat can be reached by the human intellect, and what else is the \\nuniverse but various readings of the Absolute?It is like a book \\nbefore us, and each one has brought his intellect to read it, and \\neach one has to read it for himself. \\n \\nThere is something which is common in the intellect of all men;', 'therefore, certain things appear to be the same to the intellect of \\nmankind. That you and I see a chair proves that there is \\nsomething common to both our minds. Suppose a being  comes \\nwith another sense, he will not see the chair at all; but all beings \\nsimilarly constituted will see the same things.Thus, this universe \\nitself is the Absolute, the unchangeable, the noumenon; and the \\nphenomenon constitutes the reading thereof. For you will first \\nfind that all phenomena are finite.', '62 \\n \\nEvery phenomenon that we can see, feel, or think of, is finite, \\nlimited by our knowledge, and the Personal God as we conceive \\nof Him is in fact a phenomenon. The  very idea of causation  \\nexists only in the phenomenal world, and God as the cause of \\nthis universe must naturally be thought of as limited, and yet He \\nis the same Impersonal God. \\n \\nThis very universe, as we have seen, is  the same Impersonal \\nBeing read by our intellect. Whatever  is reality in the universe', 'is that Impersonal Being, and  the forms and  conceptions are \\ngiven to it by our intellects. Whatever is real in this table is that \\nBeing, and the table form and all other forms are given by our \\nintellects. Now, motion, for instance, which is a nece ssary \\nadjunct of the phenomenal, cannot be predicated of the \\nUniversal. Every little bit, every atom inside the universe, is in \\na constant state of change and motion, but the universe as  a', 'whole is unchangeable, because motion or  change is a relative \\nthing; we can only think of something in motion in comparison \\nwith something which is not moving. \\n \\nThere must be two things in order to understand motion. The \\nwhole mass of the universe, taken as a unit, cannot move. In \\nregard to what will it move? It cannot be said to change. With \\nregard to what will it change? So the whole is the Absolute; but \\nwithin it every particle is in a constant state of flux and change.', 'It is unchangeable and changeable at the same time, Impersonal \\nand Personal in one. This is our conception of the  universe, of', '63 \\n \\nmotion and of God, and that is what is meant by \"Thou art That\". \\nThus we see that the Impersonal instead of doing away with the \\npersonal, the Absolute instead of pulling down the relative, only \\nexplains it to the full satisfaction of our reason and heart. \\n \\nThe Personal God and all that exists in the universe are the same \\nImpersonal Being seen through our minds. When we shall be rid \\nof our minds, our little personalities, we shall become one with', 'It. This is what is meant by \"Thou art That\".  \\n \\nFor we must know our true nature, the Absolute. The finite, \\nmanifested man forgets his source and  thinks himself to be \\nentirely separate. We, as personalised, differentiated beings, \\nforget our reality, a nd the teaching of monism is not that we \\nshall give up these differentiations, but we must learn to \\nunderstand what they are. We are in reality that Infinite Being, \\nand our personalities represent so many channels through which', 'this Infinite Reality is manifesting Itself; and the whole mass of \\nchanges which we call evolution is brought about by the soul \\ntrying to manifest more and more of its  infinite energy. We  \\ncannot stop anywhere on this side of the Infinite; our power, and \\nblessedness, and wisdom, canno t but grow into the Infinite. \\nInfinite power and existence and blessedness  are ours, and we \\nhave not to acquire them; they are our own, and we have only to', 'manifest them. This is the central idea of monism, and one that \\nis so hard to understand.', '64 \\n \\nFrom my childhood everyone around me taught weakness; I \\nhave been told ever since I was born that I was a weak thing. It \\nis very difficult for me now to realise my own strength, but by \\nanalysis and reasoning I gain knowledge of my own strength, I \\nrealise it. All the knowledge that we have in this world, where \\ndid it come from? It was within us. What knowledge is outside? \\nNone. Knowledge was not in matter; it was in man all the time.', 'Nobody ever created knowledge; man brings it from within. It \\nis lying there. The  whole of that big banyan tree  which covers \\nacres of ground, was in the little seed which was, perhaps, no \\nbigger than one eighth of a mustard seed; all that mass of energy \\nwas there confined. The gigantic intellect, we know, lies coiled \\nup in the protoplasmic cell, and why should not  the infinite \\nenergy? We know that it is so. It may seem like a paradox, but', 'is true. Each one of us has come out of one protoplasmic cell, \\nand all the powers we possess were coiled up there. You cannot \\nsay they came from food; for if you heap up food mountains \\nhigh, what power comes out of it? The energy was there, \\npotentially no doubt, but still there. So is infinite power in the \\nsoul of man, whether he knows it or not.Its manifestation is only \\na question of being conscious of it. Slowly this infinite giant is,', 'as it were, waking up, becoming conscious of his power, and \\narousing himself; and with his growing consciousness, more and \\nmore of his bonds are breaking, chains are bursting asunder, and \\nthe day is sure to come when, with the full consciousness of his \\ninfinite power and  wisdom, the giant will rise to his feet and \\nstand erect. Let us all help to hasten that glorious consummation.', '65 \\n \\nPart - 4 \\n(Delivered in London, 18th November 1896) \\nWe have been dealing more with the universal so far. This \\nmorning, I shall try to place before you the Vedantic ideas of the \\nrelation of the particular to the universal. As we have seen, in  \\nthe dualistic form of Vedic doctrines, the earlier forms, there was \\na clearly defined particular and limited soul for every being. \\nThere have been a great many theories about this particular soul', 'in each individual, but the main discussion was between the \\nancient Vedantists and the ancient Buddhists, the former \\nbelieving in the individual soul as complete in itself, the latter \\ndenying in toto the existence of such an individual soul.  \\nAs I told you the other day, it is pretty much the same discussion \\nyou have in Europe as to substance and quality, one set holding \\nthat b ehind the qualities there is something as substance,  in', 'which the qualities in here; and the other denying the existence \\nof such a substance as being unnecessary, for the qualities may \\nlive by themselves. The most  ancient theory of the soul, of \\ncourse, is based upon the argument of self -identity— \"I am I\" \\n— that the I of yesterday is the I of today, and the I of today will \\nbe the I of tomorrow; that in spite of all the changes  that are \\nhappening to the body, I yet believe that I am the same I. This', 'seems to have been the central argument with those who \\nbelieved in a limited, and yet perfectly complete, individual \\nsoul.', '66 \\n \\n On the other hand, the ancient Buddhists denied the necessity \\nof such an assumption. They brought forward the argument that \\nall that we know, and all that we possibly can know, are simply \\nthese changes. The positing of an unchangeable and unchanging \\nsubstance is simply superfluous, and even if there were any such \\nunchangeable thing, we could never understand it, nor should \\nwe ever be able to cognise it in any sense of the word. The same', 'discussion you will find at the present time going on in Europe \\nbetween the religionists and the idealists on the one side, and \\nthe modern positivists and agnostics on the other; one set \\nbelieving there is something which does not change (of whom \\nthe latest representative is your Herbert Spencer), that we catch \\na glimpse of something which is unchangeable. And the other is \\nrepresented by the modern Comtists and modern Agnostics.  \\nThose of you who were interested a few years ago in the', 'discussions between Herbert Spencer and Frederick Harrison \\nmight have noticed that it was the same old difficulty, the one \\nparty standing for a substance behind the changeful, and the \\nother party denying the necessity for such an  assumption. One \\nparty says we cannot conceive of changes without conceiving of \\nsomething which does not change; the other party brings out the \\nargument that this is superfluous; we can only conceive of', 'something which is changing, and as to the unchanging, we can \\nneither know, feel, nor sense it. \\n In India this great question did not find its solution in very \\nancient times, because we have seen that the assumption of a \\nsubstance which is behind the qualities, and which is not the', '67 \\n \\nqualities, can never be substantiated; nay, even the argument \\nfrom self- identity, from memory, — that I am the I of yesterday \\nbecause I remember it, and therefore I have been a continuous \\nsomething — cannot be substantiated. The other quibble that is \\ngenerally put forward is a mere delusion of words. For instance, \\na man may take a long series of such sentences as \"I do\", \"I go\", \\n\"I dream\", \"I sleep\", \"I move\", and here you will find it claimed', 'that the doing, going, dreaming etc.,  have been changing, but \\nwhat remained constant was that \"I\".  \\nAs such they conclude that the \"I\" is something which is \\nconstant and an individual in itself, but all these changes belong \\nto the body. This, though apparently very conv incing\\n \\nand clear, \\nis based upon the mere play on words. The \"I\" and the doing, \\ngoing, and dreaming may be separate in black and white, but no \\none can separate them in his mind. When I eat, I think of myself', 'as eating — I am identified with eating. When I run, I and the \\nrunning are not two separate things. Thus the argument from \\npersonal identity does not seem to be very strong. The other \\nargument from memory is also weak.  \\nIf the identity of my being is represented by my memory, many \\nthings which I have forgotten are lost from that identity. And we \\nknow that people under certain conditions forget their whole \\npast. In many cases of lunacy, a man will think of himself as', 'made of glass, or as being an animal. If the existence of that man \\ndepends on memory, he has become glass,  which not being the \\ncase we cannot make the identity of the Self depend on such  a \\nflimsy substance as  memory. Thus, we see that the  soul as a', '68 \\n \\nlimited yet complete and continuing identity cannot be \\nestablished as separate from the qualities. \\n \\nWe cannot establish a narrowed -down, limited existence to \\nwhich is attached a bunch of qualities. On the other hand, the \\nargument of the ancient Buddhists seems to be stronger that  —  \\nwe do not know, and cannot know, anything that is beyond the \\nbunch of qualities. According to them, the soul consists  of a \\nbundle of qualities called sensations and feelings. A mass of', 'such is what is  called the soul, and this mass is continually \\nchanging. The Advaitist theory of the soul reconciles both these \\npositions. The position of the Advaitist is that it is true that we \\ncannot think of the substance as separate from the qualities, we \\ncannot think of change and not -change at the same time; it \\nwould be impossible. But the very thing which is the substance \\nis the quality; substance and quality are not two things. It is the', 'unchangeable that is appearing as the changeable.  \\n \\nThe unchangeable substance of the universe is not something \\nseparate from it. The noumenon  is not something different from \\nthe phenomena, but it is the very noumenon which has become \\nthe phenomena. There is a soul which is unchanging, and what \\nwe call feelings and perceptions, nay, even the body, are the \\nvery soul, seen from another point of view. We have got into the \\nhabit of thinking that we have bodies and souls and so forth, but', 'really speaking, there is only one.', '69 \\n \\nWhen I think of  myself as the body, I  am only a body; it is \\nmeaningless to say I am something else. And when I th ink of \\nmyself as the soul, the body vanishes, and the perception of the \\nbody does not remain. None can get the perception of the Self \\nwithout his perception of the body having vanished, none can \\nget perception of the substance without his perception of the  \\nqualities having vanished. The ancient illustration of Advaita,', 'of the rope being taken for a snake, may elucidate the point a \\nlittle more. When a man mistakes the rope for a snake, the rope \\nhas vanished, and when he takes it for a rope, the snake has \\nvanished, and the rope only remains. The ideas of dual or treble \\nexistence come from reasoning on insufficient data, and we read \\nthem in books or hear about them, until we come under  the \\ndelusion that we really have a dual perception of the soul and the \\nbody; but such a perception never really exists.', 'body; but such a perception never really exists. \\n \\nThe perception is either of the body or of the soul. It requires no \\narguments to prove it, you can verify it in your own minds. Try \\nto think of yourself as a soul, as a disembodied something. You \\nwill find it to be almost impossible, and those few who are able \\nto do so will find that at the time when they realise themselves \\nas a soul, they have no idea of the body. You have heard of, or', 'perhaps have seen, persons who on particular occasions had \\nbeen in peculiar s tates of mind, brought about by deep \\nmeditation, self -hypnotism, hysteria, or drugs. From their \\nexperience you may gather that when they were perceiving  the \\ninternal something, the external had vanished for them. This \\nshows that whatever exists is one. That one is appearing in these', '70 \\n \\nvarious forms, and all these various forms give rise to the \\nrelation of cause and effect.  \\n \\nThe relation of cause and effect is one of evolution — the one \\nbecomes the other, and so on. Sometimes the cause vanishes, as \\nit were, and in its place leaves the effect. If the soul is the cause \\nof the body, the soul, as it were, vanishes for the time being, and \\nthe body remains; and when the body vanishes, the soul \\nremains. This theory fits the arguments of the Buddhists that', 'were levelled against the assumption of the dualism of body and \\nsoul, by denying the duality, and showing that the substance and \\nthe qualities are one and the same thing appearing in various \\nforms.  \\n \\nWe have seen also that this idea of the unchangeable can be \\nestablished only as regards the whole, but never as regards the \\npart. \\n \\nThe very idea of part comes from the idea of change or motion. \\nEverything that is limited we can understand and know, because', 'it is changeable; and the whole must be unchangeable, because \\nthere is no other thing besides it in relation  to which change \\nwould be possible. Change is always in regard to something \\nwhich does not change, or which changes relatively less. \\nAccording to Advaita, therefore, the idea  of the soul as \\nuniversal, unchangeable, and immortal can be  demonstrated as \\nfar as possible.', '71 \\n \\n \\nThe difficulty would be as regards the particular. What shall we \\ndo with the old dualistic theories which have such  a hold upon \\nus, and which we have all  to pass through — these beliefs in \\nlimited, little, individual souls? We have seen that we are \\nimmortal with regard to the whole;  but the difficulty is, we \\ndesire so much to be immortal as parts of the whole. We have \\nseen that we are Infinite, and that that is  our real individuality.', 'But we want so much to make these little souls individual. What \\nbecomes of them when we find in our everyday experience that \\nthese little souls are individuals, with only this reservation that \\nthey are continuously growing individuals? They  are the same, \\nyet not the same.  \\n \\nThe ‘I’ of yesterday is the ‘I’ of today, and yet  not so,  it is \\nchanged somewhat. Now, by getting rid of the dualistic \\nconception, that in the midst of all these changes there is', 'something that does not change, and taking the most modern of \\nconceptions, that of evolution, we find that the \"I\" is a \\ncontinuously changing, expanding entity. If it be true that man \\nis the evolution of a mollusc, the mollusc individual is the same \\nas the man, only it  has to become expanded a great deal. From \\nmollusc to man, it has been a continuous expansion towards \\ninfinity. \\n \\nTherefore the limited soul can be styled an individual which is', 'continuously expanding towards the Infinite Individual. Perfect \\nindividuality will only be reached when it has reached the', '72 \\n \\nInfinite, but on this side of the Infinite it is a continuously \\nchanging, growing personality. One of the remarkable features \\nof the Advaitist system of Vedanta is to harmonise the preceding \\nsystems. In many cases it helped the philosophy very much; in \\nsome cases it hurt it. Our ancient philosophers knew what you \\ncall the theory of evolution; that growth is gradual, step by step, \\nand the recognition of this led them to harmonise all the \\npreceding systems.', 'preceding systems. \\n \\nThus, not one of these preceding ideas was rejected. The fault \\nof the Buddhistic faith was that it had neither the faculty nor the \\nperception of this continual, expansive growth, and for this \\nreason it never even made an attempt to harmonise itself with  \\nthe preexisting steps towards the ideal. They were rejected as \\nuseless and harmful. \\n \\nThis tendency in religion is most harmful. A man gets a new and', 'better idea, and then he looks back on those he has given up, and \\nforthwith decides that they were mischievous and unnecessary. \\nHe never thinks that, however crude they may appear  from his \\npresent point of view, they were very useful to him, that they \\nwere necessary for him to reach his present state, and that \\neveryone of us has to grow in a similar fashion, living first on \\ncrude ideas, taking benefit from them, and then arriving at a', 'higher standard. With the oldest theories, therefore, the Advaita \\nis friendly.', '73 \\n \\nDualism and all systems that had preceded it are accepted by the \\nAdvaita not in a patronising way, but with the conviction that \\nthey are true manifestations of the same truth, and that they all \\nlead to the same conclusions as the Advaita has reached.  \\n \\nWith b lessing, and not with cursing, should be preserved all \\nthese various steps through which humanity has to pass. \\nTherefore, all these dualistic systems have never been rejected', 'or thrown out, but have been kept intact in the Vedanta; and the \\ndualistic conception of an individual soul, limited yet complete \\nin itself, finds its place in the Vedanta. According to dualism, \\nman dies and goes to other worlds, and so forth; and these ideas \\nare kept in the Vedanta in their entirety. For with the recognition \\nof growth in the Advaitist system, these theories are given their \\nproper place by admitting that they represent only a partial view', \"of the Truth. From the dualistic standpoint this universe can only \\nbe looked upon as a creation of matter or force, can only be \\nlooked upon as the play of a certain will, and that will again can \\nonly be looked upon as separate from the universe. \\n \\nThus, a man from such a standpoint has to see himself as \\ncomposed of a dual nature, body and soul, and this soul, though \\nlimited, is individually complete in itself. Such a man's ideas of\", 'immortality and of the future life would necessarily accord with \\nhis idea of soul. These phases have been kept in the  Vedanta, \\nand it is, therefore, necessary for me to present to you a few of \\nthe popular ideas of dualism. According to this\\n \\ntheory, we have \\na body, of course, and behind the body there is what they call a', '74 \\n \\nfine body. This fine body is also made of matter, only very fine. \\nIt is the receptacle of all our Karma, of all our actions and \\nimpressions, which are ready to spring up into visible forms. \\nEvery thought that we think, every deed that we do, after a \\ncertain time becomes fine, goes into seed form, so to speak, and \\nlives in the fine body in a potential form, and after a time it \\nemerges again and bears its results. \\n \\nThese results condition the life of man. Thus, he moulds his own', 'life. Man is not bound by any other laws excepting those which \\nhe makes for himself. Our thoughts, our words and deeds are the \\nthreads of the net which we throw round ourselves, for good or \\nfor evil. Once we set in motion a certain power, we have to take \\nthe full consequences of it. This is the law of Karma. Behind the \\nsubtle body, lives Jiva or the individual soul of man. There are \\nvarious discussions about the form and the size of this individual', 'soul. According to some, it is very small like an atom; according \\nto others, it is not so small as that; according to others, it is very \\nbig, and so on. This Jiva is a part  of that universal substance, \\nand it is  also eternal;  without beginning it is existing, and \\nwithout end it will exist. It is passing through all these forms in \\norder to manifest its real nature which is purity. Every action \\nthat retards this manifestation is called an  evil action, so with \\nthoughts.', 'thoughts.  \\n \\nAnd every action and every thought that helps the Jiva to expand, \\nto manifest its real nature, is good. One theory that is held in \\ncommon in India by the crudest dualists as well as by the most', '75 \\n \\nadvanced non-dualists is that all the possibilities and powers of \\nthe soul are within it, and do not come from any external source. \\nThey are in the soul in potential form,  and the whole work of \\nlife is simply directed towards manifesting those potentialities.  \\n \\nThey have also the theory of reincarnation which says that after \\nthe dissolution of this body, the Jiva will have another, and after \\nthat has been dissolved, it will again have another, and so on,', 'either here or in some other worlds; but this world is given the \\npreference, as it is considered the best of  all worlds  for our \\npurpose. Other worlds are conceived of as worlds where there is \\nvery little misery, but for that very reason, they argue, there is \\nless chance of thinking of  higher things  there. As this world \\ncontains some happiness and a good deal  of misery, the Jiva \\nsome time or other gets awakened, as it were, and thinks of', 'freeing itself. But just as very rich persons in this world have the \\nleast chance of thinking of higher things, so the Jiva in heaven \\nhas little chance of progress, for its condition is the same as that \\nof a rich man, only more intensified; it has a very fine body \\nwhich knows no disease, and is under no necessity of eating or \\ndrinking, and all its desires are fulfilled. The  Jiva lives there, \\nhaving enjoyment after enjoyment, and so forgets all about its', 'real nature. Still there are some higher worlds, where in spite of \\nall enjoyments, its further evolution is possible. Some dualists \\nconceive of the goal as the highest heaven, where souls will live \\nwith God for ever.', '76 \\n \\nThey will have beautiful bodies and will  know neither disease \\nnor death, nor any other evil, and all their desires will be  \\nfulfilled. From time to time some of them will come back to this \\nearth and take another body to teach human beings the way to \\nGod; and the great teachers of the world have been such. They \\nwere already free, and were living with God in the highest \\nsphere; but their love and sympathy for suffering humanity was', 'so great that they came and incarnated again to teach mankind \\nthe way to heaven. Of course, we know that the Advaita holds \\nthat this cannot be the goal or the ideal; bodilessness must be \\nthe ideal. The ideal cannot be finite. \\n \\nAnything short of the Infinite c annot be the ideal, and there \\ncannot be an infinite body. That would be impossible, as body \\ncomes from limitation. There cannot be infinite thought,\\n \\nbecause \\nthought comes from limitation. We have to go beyond the body,', 'and beyond thought too, says the Advaita. \\n \\nAnd we have also seen that, according to Advaita, this freedom \\nis not to be attained, it is already ours. We only forget it and \\ndeny it. Perfection is not to be attained, it is already within  us. \\nImmortality and bliss are not to be acquired, we p ossess them \\nalready; they have been ours all the time. If you dare declare that \\nyou are free, free you are this moment. If you say you are bound,', 'bound you will remain. This is what Advaita boldly declares. I \\nhave told you the ideas of the dualists. You can take whichever \\nyou like. The highest ideal of the Vedanta is very difficult to \\nunderstand, and people are always quarrelling about it, and the', '77 \\n \\ngreatest difficulty is that when they get hold of certain ideas, \\nthey deny and fight other ideas.  \\n \\nTake up what suits you, and let others take up what they need. If \\nyou are desirous of clinging to this little individuality, to this \\nlimited manhood, remain in it, have all these desires, and be  \\ncontent and pleased with them. If your experience of  manhood \\nhas been very good and nice, retain it as long as you like; and you', 'can do so, for you are the makers of your own fortunes; none can \\ncompel you to give up your manhood. You will be men  as long \\nas you like; none can prevent you. If you want to be angels, you \\nwill be angels, that is the law. But there may be others who do \\nnot want to be angels even. What right have you to think that \\ntheirs is a horrible notion? You may be frightened to lose a \\nhundred pounds, but there may be others who would not even', 'wink if they lost all the money they had in the world. There have \\nbeen such men and still there are. Why do you dare to judge them \\naccording to your standard? You cling on to your limitations, and \\nthese little worldly ideas may be your highest ideal. You are \\nwelcome to them. It will be to you as you wish. \\n \\nBut there are others who have seen the truth and cannot rest in \\nthese limitations, who have done with these things and want to', 'get beyond. The world with all its enjoyments is a mere mud - \\npuddle for them. Why do you want to bind them down to  your \\nideas? You must get rid of this tendency once for all. Accord a \\nplace to everyone. I once read a story about some ships that were \\ncaught in a cyclone in the South Sea Islands, and there was a', '78 \\n \\npicture of it in the Illustrated Londo n News. All of them were \\nwrecked except one English vessel, which weathered the storm.  \\n \\nThe picture showed the men who were going to be drowned, \\nstanding on the decks and cheering the people who were sailing \\nthrough the storm (H.M.S. Calliope and the Amer ican men-of-\\nwar at Samoa. — Ed). Be brave and generous like that. Do not \\ndrag others down to where you are. Another foolish notion is that', 'if we lose our little individuality,  there will be no morality, no \\nhope for humanity.  \\n \\nAs if everybody had been dying for humanity all the time! God \\nbless you! If in every country there were two hundred men and \\nwomen really wanting to do good to humanity, the millennium \\nwould come in five days. We know how we are dying for \\nhumanity! These are all tall talks, and not hing else. The history \\nof the world shows that those who never thought of  their little', 'individuality were the  greatest benefactors of the human race, \\nand that the more men and women think of themselves, the less \\nare they able to do for others. One is unselfishness, and the other \\nselfishness. Clinging on to little enjoyments, and to desire the \\ncontinuation and repetition of this state of things is utter \\nselfishness. It arises not from any desire for truth, its genesis is \\nnot in kindness for other beings, but in the utter selfishness of the', 'human heart, in the idea, \"I will have everything, and do not care \\nfor anyone else.\" This is as it appears to me. I would like to see  \\nmore moral men in the world  like some of those grand old \\nprophets and sages of ancient times who would have given up', '79 \\n \\na hundred lives\\n \\nif they could by so doing benefit one little \\nanimal! \\n \\nTalk of morality and doing good to others! Silly talk of the \\npresent time! I would like to see moral men like Gautama \\nBuddha, who did not believe in a Personal God or a personal \\nsoul, never asked about them, but was a perfect agnostic, and \\nyet was ready to lay down his life for anyone, and worked all \\nhis life for the good of all, and thought only of the good of all.', 'Well, it has been said by his biographer, in describing his birth, \\nthat he was born for the good of the many, as a blessing to the \\nmany. He did not go to the forest to meditate for his own \\nsalvation; he felt that the world was burning, and that he must \\nfind a way out. \"Why is there so much misery in the world?” — \\nwas the one question that dominated his whole life. Do you \\nthink we are so moral as the Buddha? \\n \\nThe more selfish a man, the more immoral he is. And so also', 'with the race. That race which is bound down to itself has been \\nthe most cruel and the most wicked in the whole world. There \\nhas not been a religion that has clung to this dualism more than \\nthat founded by the Prophet of Arabia, and there has not been a \\nreligion which has shed so much blood and been so crue l to \\nother men. In the Koran there is the doctrine that a man who \\ndoes not believe these teachings should be killed; it is a mercy', 'to kill him! And the surest way to get to heaven, where there are \\nbeautiful houris and all sorts of sense -enjoyments, is by killing \\nthese unbelievers. Think of the bloodshed there has been in', '80 \\n \\nconsequence of such beliefs! In the religion of Christ there was \\nlittle of crudeness; there is very little difference between the \\npure religion of Christ and that of the Vedanta. You find t here \\nthe idea of oneness; but Christ also preached dualistic ideas to \\nthe people in order to give them something tangible to take hold \\nof, to lead them up to the highest ideal. \\n \\nThe same Prophet who preached, \"Our Father which art in', 'heaven\", also preached, \"I and my Father are one\", and the same \\nProphet knew that through the \"Father in heaven\" lies the way \\nto the \"I and my Father are one\". There was only blessing and \\nlove in the religion of Christ; but as soon as crudeness crept in, \\nit was degraded into something not much better than the religion \\nof the Prophet of Arabia. It was crudeness indeed — this fight \\nfor the little self, this clinging on to the \"I\", not only in this life,', 'but also in the desire for its continuance even after death. This \\nthey declare to be unselfishness; this the foundation of morality! \\nLord help us, if this be the foundation of morality! \\n \\nAnd strangely enough, men and women who ought to know \\nbetter think all morality will be destroyed if these little selves go \\nand stand aghast at the  idea that morality can only stand upon  \\ntheir destruction. The watchword of all well-being, of all moral', 'good is not \"I\" but \"thou\". Who cares whether there is a heaven \\nor a hell, who cares if there is a soul or not, who cares if there is \\nan unchangeable or not?', '81 \\n \\nHere is the world, and it is full of misery. Go out into it as \\nBuddha did, and struggle to lessen it or die in the attempt. Forget \\nyourselves; this is the first lesson to be learnt, whether you  are \\na theist or an atheist, whether you are an agnostic or a Vedantist, \\na Christian or a Mohammedan. The one lesson obvious to all is \\nthe destruction of the little self and the building up of  the Real \\nSelf. Two forces have been working side by side in parallel \\nlines.', 'lines. \\n \\nThe one says \"I\", the other says \"not I\". Their manifestation is \\nnot only in man but in animals,  not only in animals but in the \\nsmallest worms.  The tigress  that plunges her fangs into the \\nwarm blood of a human being would give up her own life to \\nprotect her young.The most depraved man who thinks nothing \\nof taking the lives of his brother men will, perhaps, sacrifice \\nhimself without any hesitation to save his starving wife and', 'children. Thus, throughout creation these two forces are \\nworking side by side; where you find the one, you find the other \\ntoo. The one is selfishness, the other is unselfishness.  \\n \\nThe one is acquisition, the other is renunciation. The one takes, \\nthe other gives. From th e lowest to the  highest, the  whole \\nuniverse is the playground of  these two forces. It does not \\nrequire any demonstration; it is obvious to all. What  right has', 'any section of the  community to base  the whole work and \\nevolution of the universe upon one of these two factors alone, \\nupon competition and struggle? What right  has it to base the \\nwhole working of  the universe upon passion and fight, upon', '82 \\n \\ncompetition and struggle? That these exist we do not deny; but \\nwhat right has anyone to deny the working of the  other force? \\nCan any man deny that love, this \"not I\", this renunciation is the \\nonly positive power in the universe? That other is only  the \\nmisguided employment of the power of love; the power of love \\nbrings competition; the real genesis  of competition is in love. \\nThe real genesis of evil is in unselfishness. The creator of evil is', 'good, and the end is also good.  It is only misdirection of the \\npower of good. \\n \\nA man who murders another is, perhaps, moved to do so by the \\nlove of his own child. His  love has become limited to that one \\nlittle baby, to the exclusion of the millions of other human \\nbeings in the universe. Yet, limited or unlimited, it is the same \\nlove. Thus the motive power of the whole universe, in whatever \\nway it manifests itself, is th at one wonderful thing,', 'unselfishness, renunciation, love, the real, the only living force \\nin existence. \\n \\nTherefore, the Vedantist insists upon that oneness. We insist \\nupon this explanation because we cannot admit two causes of  \\nthe universe. If we simply h old that by limitation the same \\nbeautiful, wonderful love appears to be evil or vile, we find\\n \\nthe \\nwhole universe explained by  the one force of love. If not, two \\ncauses of the universe have to be taken for granted, one good', 'and the other evil, one love and the other hatred. Which is more \\nlogical? Certainly, the oneforce theory. Let us now pass on to \\nthings which do  not possibly belong to dualism. I cannot stay', '83 \\n \\nlonger with the dualists. I am afraid. My idea is to show that the \\nhighest ideal of morality and unselfishness goes hand in hand \\nwith the highest metaphysical conception, and that you need not \\nlower your conception to get ethics and morality, but, on the \\nother hand, to reach a real basis of morality and ethics you must \\nhave the highest philosophical and scientific conceptions. \\nHuman knowledge is not antagonistic to human well-being. On', 'the contrary, it  is knowledge alone that will save  us in every \\ndepartment of life — in knowledge is worship. The more we \\nknow the better for us. The Vedantist says, the cause of all that \\nis apparently evil is the limitation of the unlimited. \\n \\nThe love which gets limited into little channels and seems to be \\nevil eventually comes out at the other end and manifests itself \\nas God. The Vedanta also says that the cause of all this apparent', 'evil is in ourselves. Do not blame any supernatural being, \\nneither be hopeless and despondent, nor think we are in a place \\nfrom which we can never escape unless someone comes and \\nlends us a helping hand. \\n \\nThat cannot be, says the Vedanta. We are like silkworms; we \\nmake the thread out of our own substance and spin the cocoon, \\nand in  course of time are imprisoned inside. But this is not \\nforever. In that cocoon we shall develop spiritual realisation,', 'and like the butterfly come out free. This network of Karma we \\nhave woven around ourselves; and in our ignorance  we feel as \\nif we are bound, and weep and wail for help. But help does not \\ncome from without; it  comes from within ourselves. Cry  to all', '84 \\n \\nthe gods in the universe. I cried for years, and in the end I found \\nthat I was helped. But help came from within. And I had to undo \\nwhat I had done by mistake. \\n  \\nThat is the only way. I had to cut the net which I had thrown \\nround myself, and the power to do this is within.

What we are to understand is this, that \\nwhat we call mistakes or evil, we commit because we are weak, \\nand we are weak because we are ignorant. I prefer to call them \\nmistakes. The word sin, although  originally a very good word, \\nhas got a certain flavour about it that frightens me. Who makes \\nus ignorant? We ourselves.

This is the one prayer, to \\nremember our  true nature, the God who is always within us, \\nthinking of it always as infinite, almighty, ever -good, ever -\\nbeneficent, selfless, bereft of all limitations.

I shall try to harmonise the various thoughts \\non the subject, as they have come up from time to time among', 'Indian philosophers. I shall try to harmonise the psychologists \\nand the metaphysicians, and, if possible, I shall harmonise them \\nwith modern scientific thinkers also.', '89 \\n \\nThe one t heme of the Vedanta philosophy is the search after \\nunity. The Hindu mind does not care for the particular; it is \\nalways after the general, nay, the universal. \"What is that, by \\nknowing which everything else is to be known?\" That is the one \\ntheme. \"As through the knowledge of one lump of clay all that \\nis of clay is known, so, what is that, by knowing which this \\nwhole universe itself will  be known?\" That is  the one search.', 'The whole of  this universe, according to the Hindu \\nphilosophers, can be resolved into one material, which they call \\nÂkâsha. Everything that we see around us, feel, touch, taste,  is \\nsimply a differentiated manifestation of this Akasha. It is  all-\\npervading, fine. All that we call solids, liquids, or gases, figures, \\nforms, or bodies, the earth,  sun, moon, and stars — everything \\nis composed of this Akasha. \\n \\nWhat force is it which acts upon this Akasha and manufactures', 'this universe out of it? Along with Akasha exists universal \\npower; all that is power in the universe, manifesting as force or \\nattraction — nay, even as thought — is but a different \\nmanifestation of that one power which the Hindus call Prâna. \\nThis Prana, acting on Akasha, is creating the whole of this \\nuniverse. In the beginning of a cycle, this Prana, as it were, \\nsleeps in the infinite ocean of Akasha. It existed motionless in \\nthe beginning. Then arises motion in this ocean of Akasha by', 'the action of this Prana, and as this Prana begins to move, to \\nvibrate, out of this ocean come the various  celestial systems, \\nsuns, moons, stars, earth, human beings, animals, plants, and the \\nmanifestations of all the various forces and phenomena.', '90 \\n \\nEvery manifestation of power, therefore, according to them, is \\nthis Prana. Every material manifestation  is Akasha. When this \\ncycle will end, all that we call solid will melt away into the next \\nform, the next finer  or the liquid form; that will melt into the \\ngaseous, and that into finer and more uniform heat\\n \\nvibrations, \\nand all will melt back into the original Akasha, and what we now \\ncall attraction, repulsion, and motion, will slowly resolve into', 'the original Prana. Then this Prana is said to sleep for a period, \\nagain to emerge and to throw out all those forms; and when this \\nperiod will end, the whole thing  will subside again. Thus this \\nprocess of creation is going down, and coming up, oscillating \\nbackwards and forwards. In the language of modern science, it \\nis becoming static during one period, and during another period \\nit is becoming dynamic. At one time it becomes potential, and \\nat the next period it becomes active.', 'at the next period it becomes active.\\n \\nThis alteration has gone on \\nthrough eternity.\\n \\n \\nYet, this analysis is only partial. This much has been known \\neven to modern physical science.  Beyond that, the research of \\nphysical science cannot reach. But the inquiry does not stop in \\nconsequence. We have not yet found that one, by knowing \\nwhich everything else will be known. We have resolved the \\nwhole universe into two components, into what are called matter', 'and energy, or what the ancient philosophers of India called \\nAkasha and Prana. The next step is to resolve this Akasha and \\nthe Prana into their origin. Both can be resolved into the still \\nhigher entity which is called mind. It is out of mind, the Mahat, \\nthe universally existing thought-power, that these two have been', '91 \\n \\nproduced. Thought is a still finer manifestation of being than \\neither Akasha or Prana. It is thought that splits itself into these \\ntwo. The universal thought existed in the beginning, and that \\nmanifested, changed, evolved itself into these two Akasha and \\nPrana: and by the combination of these two the whole universe \\nhas been produced. \\n \\nWe next come to psychology. I am looking at you. The external \\nsensations are brought to me by the eyes; they are carried by the', 'sensory nerves to the brain. The eyes are not  the organs of  \\nvision. They are but the external instruments, because if the real \\norgan behind, that which carries the sensation to the brain, is \\ndestroyed, I may have twenty eyes, yet I cannot see  you. The \\npicture on the retina may be as complete as possible, yet I shall \\nnot see you. Therefore, the organ  is different from its \\ninstruments; behind the instruments, the eyes, there must be the', 'organ. So it is with all the sensations. The nose is not the sense \\nof smell; it is but the instrument, and behind it is the organ. With \\nevery sense we have, there is first the external instrument in the \\nphysical body; behind that in the same physical body, there is \\nthe organ; yet these are not sufficient. Suppose I am talking to \\nyou, and you are listening to me with close attention. \\n \\nSomething happens, say, a bell rings; you will not, perhaps, hear', 'the bell ring. The pulsations of that sound came to your ear, \\nstruck the tympanum,  the impression was carried by the nerve \\ninto the brain; if the whole process was complete up to carrying \\nthe impulse to the brain, why did you not hear?', '92 \\n \\n \\nSomething else was wanting — the mind was not attached to the \\norgan. When the mind detaches itself from the organ, the organ \\nmay bring any news to it, but the mind will not receive it. When \\nit attaches itself to the organ, then alone is it possible for the mind \\nto receive the news. Yet, even that does not complete the whole. \\nThe instruments may bring the sensation from outside, the \\norgans may carry it inside, the mind may attach itself to the', 'organ, and yet t he perception may not be complete. One more \\nfactor is necessary; there must be a reaction within. With this \\nreaction comes knowledge. That which is  outside sends, as it \\nwere, the current of news into my brain. My mind takes it up, \\nand presents it to the intellect, which groups it in relation to pre-\\nreceived impressions and sends a current of reaction, and with \\nthat reaction comes perception. Here, then, is the will. The state', 'of mind which reacts is called Buddhi, the intellect. Yet, even \\nthis does not co mplete the whole.  One step more is required. \\nSuppose here is a camera and there is a sheet of  cloth, and I try \\nto throw a picture on that sheet. What am I to do? I am to guide \\nvarious rays of light through the camera to fall upon the sheet \\nand become grouped there. Something is necessary to have the \\npicture thrown upon, which does not move. I cannot form a', 'picture upon something which is moving; that something must \\nbe stationary, because the rays of light which I throw on it are \\nmoving, and these moving ray s of light, must be gathered, \\nunified, co-ordinated, and completed upon something which is \\nstationary.', '93 \\n \\nSimilar is the case with the sensations which these organs of \\nours are carrying inside and presenting to the mind, and which \\nthe mind in its turn is presenting to the intellect. This process \\nwill not be complete unless there is something permanent in the \\nbackground upon which the picture, as it were, may be formed, \\nupon which we may unify all the different impressions. What is \\nit that gives unity to th e changing whole of our being? What is', 'it that keeps up the identity of the moving  thing moment after \\nmoment? What is it upon which all our different impressions are \\npieced together, upon which the perceptions, as it were, come \\ntogether, reside, and form a  united whole? We have found that \\nto serve this end there must be something, and we also see that \\nthat something must be, relatively to the body and mind,  \\nmotionless. The sheet of cloth upon which the camera throws the', 'picture is, relatively to the rays of  light, motionless, else there \\nwill be no picture. That is to say, the perceiver must be an \\nindividual. This something upon which the mind is painting all \\nthese pictures, this something  upon which  our sensations, \\ncarried by the mind and intellect, are plac ed and grouped and \\nformed into a unity, is what is called the soul of man. \\n \\nWe have seen that it is the universal cosmic mind that splits', 'itself into the Akasha and Prana, and beyond mind we have \\nfound the soul in us. In the universe, behind the universal mind, \\nthere is a Soul that exists, and it is called God. In the individual \\nit is the soul of man. In this universe, in the cosmos, just as the \\nuniversal mind becomes evolved into Akasha and Prana, even \\nso, we may find that the Universal Soul Itself becomes evolved', '94 \\n \\nas mind. Is it really so with the individual man? Is his mind the \\ncreator of his body, and his soul the creator of his mind? That is \\nto say, are his body, his mind, and his  soul three different \\nexistences or are they three in one or, again, are they different \\nstates of existence of the same unit being? We shall gradually \\ntry to find an answer to this question. The first step that we have \\nnow gained is this: here is this external body, behind this', 'external body are the organs, the mind, the intellect, and behind \\nthis is the soul. At the first step, we have found, as it were, that \\nthe soul is separate from the body, separate from the mind itself. \\nOpinions in the religious world become divided at this point, and \\nthe departure is this. All those religious views which generally \\npass under the name of dualism hold that this soul is qualified, \\nthat it is of various qualities, that all feelings of enjoyment,', 'pleasure, and pain really belong to the soul. The non -dualists \\ndeny that the soul has any such qualities; they say it is \\nunqualified. \\n \\nLet me first take up the dualists, and try to present to you their \\nposition with regard to the soul and its destiny; next, the system \\nthat contradicts them; and lastly, let us try to find the harmony \\nwhich non-dualism will bring to us. This soul of man, because \\nit is separate from the mind and body, because it is not', 'composed of Akasha and Prana, must be immortal.Why?  What \\ndo we mean by mortality? Decomposition. And that  is only \\npossible for things that are the result of composition; anything \\nthat is made of two or three ingredients must become \\ndecomposed.', '95 \\n \\nThat alone which is not the result of composition can never \\nbecome decomposed, and, therefore, can never die. It is \\nimmortal. It has been existing throughout eternity; it is uncreate. \\nEvery item of creation is simply a composition; no one ever saw \\ncreation come out of nothing. All that we know of creation is the \\ncombination of already existing things into newer forms.  That \\nbeing so, this soul of man, being simple, must have been existing \\nforever, and it will exist forever.', 'forever, and it will exist forever. \\n \\nWhen this body falls off, the soul lives on. According to the \\nVedantists, when this body dissolves, the vital forces of the man \\ngo back to his mind and the mind becomes dissolved, as it were, \\ninto the Prana, and that Prana enters into the soul of man, and \\nthe soul of man comes out, clothed, as it were, with what they \\ncall the fine body, the mental body, or spiritual body, as you may \\nlike to call it. In this body are the Samskâras of the man. What', 'are the Samskaras? This mind is like a lake, and every thought \\nis like a wave upon that lake. Just as in the lake waves rise and \\nthen fall down and disappear, so  these thought -waves are \\ncontinually rising in the mind -stuff and then disappearing, but \\nthey do not disappear forever. They become finer and finer, but \\nthey are all there, ready to start up at another time when called \\nupon to do so. \\n \\nMemory is simply call ing back into waveform some of those', 'thoughts which have gone into that finer state of existence. \\nThus, everything that we have thought, every action that we have \\ndone, is lodged in the mind; it is all there in fine form, and when', '96 \\n \\na man dies, the sum total  of these impressions is in the mind, \\nwhich again works upon a little fine material as a medium. The \\nsoul, clothed, as it were, with these impressions and the fine \\nbody, passes out, and the destiny of the soul is guided by the \\nresultant of all the differen t forces represented by the different \\nimpressions. According to us, there are three different goals for \\nthe soul. \\n \\nThose that are very spiritual, when they die, follow the solar rays', 'and reach what is called the solar sphere, through which they \\nreach what is called the lunar sphere, and through that they reach \\nwhat is called the sphere of lightning, and there they meet with \\nanother soul who is already blessed, and he guides the new -\\ncomer forward to the highest of all spheres, which is called the \\nBrahmaloka, the sphere of Brahmâ. There these souls attain to \\nomniscience and omnipotence, become almost as powerful and', 'all-knowing as God Himself; and they reside there forever, \\naccording to the dualists, or, according to the non- dualists, they \\nbecome one with the Universal at the end of the cycle.  \\n \\nThe next class of persons, who have been doing good work with \\nselfish motives, are carried by the results of their good works, \\nwhen they die, to what is called lunar sphere, where there are \\nvarious heavens, and there they acquire  fine bodies, the bodies', 'of gods. They become gods and live there and enjoy the blessing \\nof heaven for a long period; and after that period is finished, the \\nold Karma is again upon them, and so they fall back again to the \\nearth; they come down through the spheres of air and clouds and', '97 \\n \\nall these various  regions, and, at last, reach the earth through \\nraindrops. \\n \\nThere on the earth they attach themselves to some cereal which \\nis eventually eaten by some man who is fit to supply them with \\nmaterial to make a new body. The last class, namely, the wicked, \\nwhen they die, become ghosts or demons, and live somewhere \\nmidway between the lunar sphere and this earth. \\n \\nSome try to disturb mankind, some are friendly; and after living', 'there for some time they also fall back to the earth and become  \\nanimals. After living for some time in an animal body they get \\nreleased, and come back, and become men again, and thus get \\none more chance to work out their salvation. We see, then, that \\nthose who have nearly attained to perfection, in whom only very \\nlittle of impurity remains, go to the Brahmaloka through the rays \\nof the sun; those who were a middling sort of people, who did', 'some good work here with the idea of going to heaven, go to the \\nheavens in the lunar sphere and there obtain god -bodies; but \\nthey have again to become men and so have one more chance to \\nbecome perfect. Those that are very wicked become ghosts and \\ndemons, and then they may have to become animals; after that \\nthey become men again and get another chance to perfect \\nthemselves. This earth is called the Karma-Bhumi, the sphere of \\nKarma. Here alone man makes his good or bad Karma. When a', 'man wants to go to heaven and does good works for that \\npurpose, he becomes as good and does not as such store up any \\nbad Karma. He just enjoys the effects of the good work he did', '98 \\n \\non earth; and when this good Karma is  exhausted, there come, \\nupon him the resultant force of  all the  evil Karma he had \\npreviously stored up in life, and that brings him down again to \\nthis earth. In the same way, those that become ghosts remain in \\nthat state, not giving rise to fresh Karma, but suffer the evil \\nresults of their past misdeeds, and later on remain for a time  in \\nan animal body without causing any fresh Karma.', 'When that period is finished, they too become men again. The \\nstates of reward and punishment due to good and bad Karmas \\nare devoid of the force generating fresh Karmas; they have only \\nto be enjoyed or suffered. If there is an extraordinarily good or \\nan extraordinarily evil Karma, it bears fruit very quickly. For \\ninstance, if a man has been doing many evil things all his life, \\nbut does one good act, the result of that good act will', 'immediately appear, but when that result has been gone through, \\nall the evil acts must produce their results also. All men who do \\ncertain good and great acts, but the general tenor of whose lives \\nhas not been correct, will become gods; and after living for some \\ntime in god-bodies, enjoying the powers of gods, they will have \\nagain to become men; when the  power of the good acts is thus \\nfinished, the old evil comes up to be worked out.', 'Those who do extraordinarily evil acts have to put on ghost and \\ndevil bodies, and when the effect of those evil actions is \\nexhausted, the little good action which remains associated with \\nthem, makes them again become men. The way to Brahmaloka, \\nfrom which there is no more fall or return, is called the', '99 \\n \\nDevayâna, i.e. the way to God; the way t o heaven is known as \\nPitriyâna, i.e. the way to the fathers. \\n \\nMan, therefore, according to the Vedanta philosophy, is the \\ngreatest being that is in the universe, and this world of work the \\nbest place in it, because only herein is the greatest and the best \\nchance for him to become perfect. Angels or gods, whatever you \\nmay call them, have all to become men, if they want to become \\nperfect. This is the great centre, the wonderful poise, and the', 'wonderful opportunity — this human life. \\n \\nWe come next to the other  aspect of philosophy. There are \\nBuddhists who deny the whole theory of the soul that I have just \\nnow been propounding. \"What use is there,\" says the Buddhist, \\n\"to assume something as the substratum, as the background of \\nthis body and mind? Why may we not allow thoughts to run on? \\nWhy admit a third substance beyond this organism, composed \\nof mind and body, a third substance called the soul? What is its', 'use? Is not this organism sufficient to explain itself? Why take \\nanew a third something?\" These arguments  are very powerful. \\nThis reasoning is very strong.  \\n \\nSo far as outside research  goes, we see that this organism is a \\nsufficient explanation of itself — at least, many of us see it in \\nthat light. Why  then need there be a soul  as substratum, as  a \\nsomething which is neither mind nor body but stands as a \\nbackground for both mind and body? Let there be only mind and', '100 \\n \\nbody. Body is the name of a stream of matter continuously \\nchanging. Mind is the name of  a stream of consciousness or \\nthought continuous ly changing. What produces the apparent \\nunity between these two? This unity does not really exist, let us \\nsay. Take, for instance, a lighted torch, and whirl it rapidly \\nbefore you. You see a circle of fire. \\n \\nThe circle does not really exist, but because the torch is \\ncontinually moving, it leaves the appearance of a circle. So', 'there is no unity in this life; it is a mass of matter continually \\nrushing down, and the whole of this matter you may call one \\nunity, but no more. So is mind; each thought is separat e from \\nevery other thought; it is only the rushing current that leaves \\nbehind the illusion of unity; there is no need of a third substance. \\nThis universal phenomenon of body and mind is all that really \\nis; do not posit something behind it. You will find th at this', 'Buddhist thought has been taken up by certain sects and schools \\nin modern times, and all of them claim that it is new — their \\nown invention. This has been the central idea of most of the \\nBuddhistic philosophies, that this world is itself all -sufficient; \\nthat you need not ask for any background at all; all that is, is this \\nsense-universe: what is the use of thinking of something as a \\nsupport to this universe?  \\n \\nEverything is the aggregate of qualities; why should there be a', 'hypothetical substance in which they should inhere? The idea of \\nsubstance comes from the rapid interchange of qualities, not \\nfrom something unchangeable which exists behind them. We', '101 \\n \\nsee how wo nderful some of these arguments are, and they \\nappeal easily to the ordinary experience of humanity — in fact, \\nnot one in a million can think of anything other than phenomena. \\nTo the vast majority of men nature appears to be only a \\nchanging, whirling, combining, mingling mass of change. Few \\nof us ever have a glimpse of the calm sea behind.  For us it is \\nalways lashed into waves; this universe appears to us only as a', 'tossing mass of waves. Thus we find these two opinions. One is \\nthat there is something behind both body and mind which is an \\nunchangeable and immovable substance; and the other is that \\nthere is no such thing as immovability or unchangeability in the \\nuniverse; it is all change and nothing but change. The solution \\nof this difference comes in the next step of thought, namely, the \\nnon-dualistic. \\n \\nIt says that the dualists are right in finding something behind all,', 'as a background which does not change; we cannot conceive \\nchange without there being something unchangeable. We can \\nonly conceive of anything  that is  changeable, by knowing \\nsomething which is less changeable, and this also must appear \\nmore changeable in comparison with something else which is \\nless changeable, and so on and on, until we are bound to admit \\nthat there must be something which never  changes at all. The \\nwhole of this manifestation must have been in a state of non -', 'manifestation, calm and silent, being the balance of opposing \\nforces, so to say, when  no force operated, because  force acts \\nwhen a disturbance of the equilibrium comes in.', '102 \\n \\nThe universe is ever hurrying on to return to that state of \\nequilibrium again. If we are certain  of any fact whatsoever, we \\nare certain of this. When the dualists claim that there is  a \\nsomething which does not change, they are perfectly right, but \\ntheir analysis that it is an underlying something which is neither \\nthe body nor the mind, a something separate from both, is  \\nwrong. So far as the Buddhists say that the whole universe is a', 'mass of change, they are perfectly right; so long as I am separate \\nfrom the universe, so long as I stand back and look at something \\nbefore me, so long as there are two things — the looker-on and \\nthe thing looked upon — it will appear always that the universe \\nis one of change, continuously changing all the time. But the \\nreality is that there is both change and changelessness in this \\nuniverse. It is not that the soul and the mind and the body are', 'three separate existences, for this organism made of these three \\nis really one. \\n \\nIt is the same thing which appears as the body, as the mind, and \\nas the thing beyond mind and body, but it is not at the same time \\nall these. He who sees the body does not see the mind even, he \\nwho sees the mind does not see that which he calls the soul, and \\nhe who sees  the soul — for him the body and mind have \\nvanished. He who sees only motion never sees absolute calm,', 'and he who sees absolute calm — for him motion has vanished. \\nA rope is taken for a snake. He who sees the rope as the snake, \\nfor him the rope has vanished, and when the delusion ceases and \\nhe looks at the rope, the snake has vanished.  There is then but \\none all -comprehending existence, and that one appears as', '103 \\n \\nmanifold. This Self or Soul or Substance is all that exists in the \\nuniverse. That Self or Substance or Soul is, in the language of \\nnon-dualism, the Brahman appearing to be manifold by the \\ninterposition of name and form. \\n \\nLook at the waves in the sea. Not one wave is really different \\nfrom the sea, but what makes the wave apparently different? \\nName and form; the form of the wave and the name which we \\ngive to it, \"wave\". This is what makes it different from the sea.', 'When name and form go, it is the same sea. Who can make any \\nreal difference between the wave and the sea? So this whole \\nuniverse is that one Unit Existence; name and form have created \\nall these various differences. As when the sun shines upon  \\nmillions of globules of water, upon each particle is seen a most \\nperfect representation of the sun, so the one Soul, the one Self, \\nthe one Existence of the  universe, being reflected on all these', 'numerous globules of varying names and forms, appears to  be \\nvarious. But it is in reality only one. There is no \"I\" nor \"you\"; \\nit is all one. It is either all \"I\" or all \"you\". This idea of duality, \\ncalf two, is entirely false, and the whole universe, as we \\nordinarily know it, is the result of this false knowledge. \\n \\nWhen discrimination comes and man finds there are not two but \\none, he finds that he is himself this universe. \"It is I who am this', 'universe as it now exists, a continuous mass of change. It is I \\nwho am beyond all changes, beyond all qualities, the eternally \\nperfect, the eternally blessed.\"', '104 \\n \\nThere is, therefore, but one Atman, one Self, eternally pure, \\neternally perfect, unchangeable, unchanged; it has never \\nchanged; and all these various changes in the universe are but \\nappearances in that one Self. \\n \\nUpon it name and form have painted all these dreams; it is the \\nform that makes the wave different from the sea. Suppose the \\nwave subsides, will the form remain? No, it will vanish. The \\nexistence of the wave was entirely dependent upon the existence', 'of the sea, but the existence of the sea was not at all dependent \\nupon the existence of the wave. The form remains so long as the \\nwave remains, but as soon as the wave leaves it, it vanishes, it \\ncannot remain.  \\n \\n \\nThis name and form is the outcome of what is called Maya. It is \\nthis Maya that is making individuals, making one appear \\ndifferent from another. Yet it has no existence. \\n \\nMaya cannot be said to exist. Form cannot be said to exist,', 'because it depends upon the existence of another thing. It cannot \\nbe said as not to exist, seeing that it makes all this difference. \\nAccording to the Advaita philosophy, then, this Maya or \\nignorance — or name and form, or, as it has been called in \\nEurope, \"time, space, and causality\" — is out of this one Infinite \\nExistence showing us the manifoldness of the universe;  in \\nsubstance, this universe is one. So long as any one thinks that \\nthere are two ultimate realities, he is mistaken.', '105 \\n \\n \\nWhen he has come to know that there is but one, he is right. This \\nis what is being proved to us every day, on the physical plane, on \\nthe mental plane, and also on the spiritual plane. \\n \\nToday it has been demonstrated that you and I, the sun, the \\nmoon, and the stars are but the different names of different spots \\nin the same ocean of matter, and that this matter is continuously \\nchanging in its configuration. This particle of energy that was in', 'the sun several months  ago may be in the human being now; \\ntomorrow it may be in an animal, the day after tomorrow it may \\nbe in a plant. It is ever coming and going. \\n \\nIt is all one unbroken, infinite mass of matter, only differentiated \\nby names and forms. One point is called the sun; another, the \\nmoon; another, the stars; another, man; another, anima l; \\nanother, plant; and so on. And all these names are fictitious; they \\nhave no reality, because the whole is a continuously changing', 'mass of matter. This very same universe, from another \\nstandpoint, is an ocean of thought, where each one of us is a \\npoint called a particular mind. You are a mind, I am a mind, \\neveryone is a mind; and the very same universe viewed from the \\nstandpoint of knowledge, when the eyes have been cleared of \\ndelusions, when the mind has become pure, appears to be the \\nunbroken Absolute Being, the ever pure, the unchangeable, the \\nimmortal.', '106 \\n \\nWhat then becomes of all this threefold eschatology of the \\ndualist, that when a man dies he goes to heaven, or goes to this \\nor that sphere, and that the wicked persons become ghosts, and \\nbecome animals, and so forth? None comes and none goes, says \\nthe non-dualist. How can you come  and go? You are infinite; \\nwhere is the place for you to go? In a certain school a number of \\nlittle children were being examined. The examiner had foolishly', 'put all sorts of difficult questions to the little children. Among \\nothers there was this question: \"Why does not the earth fall ?\" \\nHis intention was to bring out the idea of gravitation or some \\nother intricate scientific truth from these children. Most of them \\ncould n ot even understand the question, and so they gave all \\nsorts of wrong answers.  \\n \\nBut one bright little girl answered it with another question: \\n\"Where shall it fall?\" The very question of the examiner was', 'nonsense on  the face of it. There is no up and down in the \\nuniverse; the idea is only relative. So it is with regard to the soul; \\nthe very question of birth and death in regard to it is utter \\nnonsense. Who goes and who comes? Where are you not? \\nWhere is the heaven that you are not in already? Omnipresent is \\nthe Self of man. Where is it to go? Where is it not to go? It is \\neverywhere. So all this childish dream and puerile illusion of', 'birth and death, of heavens and higher heavens and lower \\nworlds, all vanish immediately for the perfect.

It continues for the ignorant.', '107 \\n \\nHow is it that the whole world believes in going to heaven, and \\nin dying and being born?

They will \\nnever see us, nor we them; we only see those who are in the same', 'state of  mind and on  the same plane with us. Those musical \\ninstruments respond which  have the same  attunement of \\nvibration, as it were; if the state of vibration, which they call \\n\"man- vibration\", should be changed, no longer would men be \\nseen here; the whole \"man- universe\" would vanish, and instead \\nof that, other scenery would come before us, perhaps gods and', '108 \\n \\nthe god-universe, or perhaps, for the wicked man, devils and the \\ndiabolic world; but all would be only different views of the one \\nuniverse. It is this universe which, from the human plane, is seen \\nas the earth, the sun, the moon, the stars, and all such things — \\nit is this very universe  which, seen from the plane of \\nwickedness, appears as a place of punishment. \\n \\nAnd this very universe is seen as heaven by those who want to', \"see it as heaven. Those who have  been dreaming of going to a \\nGod who is sitting on a throne, and of standing there praising \\nHim all their lives, when they die, will simply see a vision of \\nwhat they have in their minds; this very universe will simply \\nchange into a vast heaven, with all sorts of winged beings flying \\nabout and a God sitting on a throne. These heavens are all of \\nman's own making.  So what the dualist says is true, says the\", 'Advaitin, but it is all simply of his own making. These spheres \\nand devils and gods and reincarnations and transmigrations are \\nall mythology; so also is this human life. The great mistake that \\nmen always make is to think that this life alone is true. They \\nunderstand it well enough when other things are called \\nmythologies, but are never willing to admit the same of their \\nown position. \\n \\nThe whole thing as it appears is mere\\n \\nmythology, and the', 'mythology, and the  \\ngreatest of all lies is that we are bodies, which we never were \\nnor even can be. It is the greatest of  all lies that we are  mere \\nmen; we are the God of the universe. In worshipping God we \\nhave been always worshipping our own hidden  Self. The worst', '109 \\n \\nlie that you ever tell yourself is that you were born a sinner or a \\nwicked man.

To the \\nbaby it is all the same; because there is no robber inside, there \\nis no robber outside. To sinners and vile men, there  is vileness \\noutside, but not to good men. So the wicked see this universe as', 'a hell, and the partially good see it as heaven, while  the perfect \\nbeings realise it as God Himself. \\n \\nThen alone the veil falls from the eyes, and the man, purified \\nand cleansed, finds his whole vision changed. The bad dreams \\nthat have been torturing him for millions of years, all vanish, \\nand he who was thinking of himself either as a man, or a god, or \\na demon, he who was thinking of himself as living in low places, \\nin high places, on earth, in heaven, and so on, finds that he is', 'really omnipresent; that all time is in him, and that he is  not in \\ntime; that all the heavens are in him, that he is not in any heaven; \\nand that all the gods that man ever worshipped are in him, and \\nthat he is not in any one of those gods. \\n \\nHe was the manufacturer of gods and demons, of men and plants \\nand animals and stones, and the real  nature of man now stands \\nunfolded to him as being higher than heaven, more perfect than', 'this universe of ours, more infinite than infinite time, more \\nomnipresent than the omnipresent ether. Thus alone man', '110 \\n \\nbecomes fearless, and becomes free. Then all delusions  cease, \\nall miseries vanish, all fears come to an end for ever.

The real man is the one Unit \\nExistence. \\n \\nTwo questions now arise. The first is: \"Is it possible to realise', 'this? So far it is doctrine, philosophy, but is it possible to realise \\nit?\" It is. There are men still living in  this world for whom \\ndelusion has vanished for ever.

The man who \\nhas in this life attained to this state, for whom, for a minute at \\nleast, the ordinary vision of the world has changed and the  \\nreality has been apparent, he is called the \"Living Free\". This is', 'the goal of the Vedantin, to attain freedom while living. \\n \\nOnce in Western India I was travelling in the desert country on \\nthe coast of the Indian Ocean. For days and days I used to travel \\non foot through the desert, but it was to my surprise that I saw', '112 \\n \\nevery day beautiful lakes, with  trees all round them,  and the \\nshadows of the trees upside down and vibrating there.  \\n \\n\"How wonderful it looks and they call this a desert country!\" I \\nsaid to myself. Nearly a month I travelled, seeing these \\nwonderful lakes and trees and plants. One day I was very thirsty \\nand wanted to have a drink of water, so I started to go to one of \\nthese clear, beautiful lakes, and as I approached, it vanished.', 'And with a flash it came to my brain, \"This is the mirage about \\nwhich I have read all my life,\" and with that came also the idea \\nthat throughout the whole of this month, every day, I had been \\nseeing the mirage and did not know it. \\n \\nThe next morning I began my march. There was again the lake, \\nbut with it came also the idea that it was the mirage and not  a \\ntrue lake. So is it with this universe. We are all travelling in this', 'mirage of the world day after day, month after month, year after \\nyear, not knowing that it is a mirage. One day it will break up, \\nbut it will come back again; the body has to remain under the \\npower of past Karma, and so the mirage will come back. This \\nworld will come back upon us so long as we are bound by \\nKarma: men, women, animals, plants, our atta chments and \\nduties, all will come back to us, but not with the same power. \\nUnder the influence of the new knowledge the strength  of', 'Karma will be broken, its poison will be lost. It becomes \\ntransformed, for along with it there comes the idea that we know \\nit now, that the sharp distinction between the reality and the \\nmirage has been known.', '113 \\n \\nThis world will not then be the same world as before. There is, \\nhowever, a danger here. We see in every country people taking \\nup this philosophy and saying, \"I am beyond all virtue and vice; \\nso I am not bound by any moral laws; I may do anything I like.\" \\nYou may find many fools  in this country at the present time, \\nsaying, \"I am not bound; I am God Himself; let me do anything \\nI like.\" This is not right, although it is true that the soul is beyond', 'all laws, physical, mental, or moral.  \\n \\nWithin law is bondage; beyond law is freedom. It is also true \\nthat freedom is of the nature of the soul, it is its birthright: that \\nreal freedom of the soul shines through veils of matter in the \\nform of the apparent freedom of man. Every moment of your \\nlife you feel that you are free. We cannot live, talk, or breathe \\nfor a moment without feeling that we are free; but, at the same \\ntime, a little thought shows us that we are like machines and not', 'free. What is true then? Is this idea of freedom a delusion? \\n \\nOne party holds that the idea of freedom is a delusion; another \\nsays that the idea of bondage is a delusion. How does this \\nhappen? Man is really free, the real man cannot but be free. It is \\nwhen he comes into the world of Maya, into name and form, \\nthat he becomes bound. Free will is a misnomer. Will can never \\nbe free. How can it be? It is only when the real man has become', 'bound that his will comes into existence, and not before. \\n \\nThe will of man is bound, but that which is the foundation of \\nthat will is eternally free. So, even in the state of bondage which', '114 \\n \\nwe call human life or god -life, on earth or in heaven, there yet \\nremains to us that recollection of the freedom which is ours by \\ndivine right. \\n \\nAnd consciously or unconsciously we are all struggling towards \\nit. When a man has attained his own freedom, how can he be \\nbound by any law? No law in this universe can bind him, for this \\nuniverse itself is his. \\n \\nHe is the whole universe. Either say he is the whole universe or', \"say that to him there is no universe. How  can he have then all \\nthese little ideas about sex and about country? How can he say, \\nI am a man, I am a woman I am a child? Are they not lies? He \\nknows that they are. How can he say that these are man's rights, \\nand these others are woman's rights? Nobody has rights; nobody \\nseparately exists. There is neither man nor woman;  the soul is \\nsexless, eternally pure. It is a lie to say that I am a man or a\", 'woman, or to say that I belong to this c ountry or that. All the \\nworld is my country, the whole universe is mine, because I have \\nclothed myself with it as my body. Yet we see that there are \\npeople in this world who are ready to assert these doctrines, and \\nat the same time do things which we should call filthy; and if we \\nask them why they do so, they tell us that it is our delusion and \\nthat they can do nothing wrong. \\n \\nWhat is the test by which they are to be judged? The test is here.', '115 \\n \\nThough evil and good are both conditioned manifestations of \\nthe soul, yet evil is the most external  coating, and good is  the \\nnearer coating of the real man, the Self. And unless a man cuts \\nthrough the layer of evil he cannot reach the layer of good, and \\nunless he has passed through both the layers of good and evil he \\ncannot reach the Self. He who reaches the Self, what remains \\nattached to him? A little Karma, a little bit of the momentum of', 'past life, but it is all good momentum. Until the bad momentum \\nis entirely worked out and past impurities are entirely burnt, it is \\nimpossible for any man to see and rea lize\\n \\ntruth. So, what is left \\nattached to the man who has reached the Self and seen the truth \\nis the remnant of the good  impressions of past life,  the good \\nmomentum. Even if he lives in the body and works incessantly, \\nhe works only to do good; his lips speak only benediction to all;', 'his hands do only good works; his mind can only think good \\nthoughts; his presence is a blessing wherever  he goes. He is \\nhimself a living blessing. \\n \\nSuch a man will, by his very presence, change even the most \\nwicked persons into saints. Even if he does not speak, his very \\npresence will be a blessing to mankind. Can such men do any \\nevil; can they do wicked deeds? There is, you must remember, \\nall the difference of pole to pole between realisation and mere \\ntalking.', 'talking.  \\n \\nAny fool can talk. Even parrots talk. Talking is one thing, and \\nrealising is another. Philosophies, and doctrines, and arguments, \\nand books, and theories, and churches, and sects, and all these', '116 \\n \\nthings are good in their own way; but when that realisation \\ncomes, these things drop away. For instance, maps are good, but \\nwhen you see the country itself, and look again at the maps, what \\na great difference you find!

It', 'is, as the sages of the Vedanta say, \"even as a fruit in your hand\"; \\nyou can stand up and say, it is here. \\n \\nSo those that have realised the truth will stand up and say, \"Here \\nis the Self\". You may argue with them by the year, but they will \\nsmile at you; they will regard it all as child\\'s p rattle; they will \\nlet the child prattle on. They have realised the truth and are full. \\nSuppose you have seen a country, and another man  comes to', 'you and tries to argue with you that that country never existed, \\nhe may go on arguing indefinitely, but your only attitude of \\nmind towards him must be to hold that the man is fit for a lunatic \\nasylum.

Are  you \\nready? Do you want it? You will get the realisation if you do,', 'and then you will be truly religious.  Until you have attained \\nrealisation there is no difference between you and atheists. The \\natheists are sincere, but the man who says that he believes in \\nreligion and never attempts to realise it is not sincere. \\n \\nThe next question is to know what comes after realisation.', '117 \\n \\nSuppose we have realised this oneness of the universe, that we \\nare that one Infinite Being, and suppose we have realised that \\nthis Self is the only Existence and that it is the same Self which \\nis manifesting in all these various phenomenal forms, what \\nbecomes of us after that?

So men stand up and say, \"What good will this do  to', 'the world; will it give us money?\" \"No.\" \"Then what good is \\nthere in it?\" That is what men mean by doing good to the world. \\nYet religious realisation does all the good to the world. People \\nare afraid that when they attain to it, when they realise that there \\nis but one, the fountains of love will be dried up, that everything \\nin life will go away, and that all they love will vanish for them, \\nas it were, in this life and in the life to come.
